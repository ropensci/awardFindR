        state turned to “rehabilitation” of citizens through labor camps, Soviet pedagogy
        designed to create a “Communist personality in every child” and finally, Fidel’s
        launch of the Mariel Boatlift in 1980—a policy to rid Cuba of critics accused
        of lacking “revolutionary genes”. What was it like to grow up in this Cuba?
        How did leaders go from “teaching the work of the Revolution” to repression
        and exclusion?  Through unused archives and oral history, I delve into the
        mechanisms through which grassroots support was constructed and challenged.

        it uses technology, enforcement, litigation, and lobbying to combat counterfeiting

        of disparate forces that had existed for centuries. It now plays a major,
        but largely unacknowledged, role in shaping the information society itself.
        I propose writing the first history of this industry. Starting with the guild

        a close relationship with the French monastic order of Cluny, and exerted
        dominance over the Islamic states to the south. This project challenges all

        Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, then Audley Moore
        midwifed modern black nationalism. Indeed, Moore created or was involved in
        many of the major movement moments and organizations now considered to be
        central to 20th century black radical organizing from the 1920s to the 1990s.
        Queen Mother” Audley Moore: Mother of Black Nationalism is the first full
        length biography of Moore—one of the most influential yet understudied activists
        and thinkers of the 20th century. The book examines Moore’s life and activism
        from the 1890s until her death in 1997 and argues that she was an important
        but overlooked progenitor of 20th century black radical thought whose organizing
        approaches and ideas became the architecture of modern radical black activism.
        Using Moore as a thread, the book offers a wide-ranging history of twentieth-century
        black nationalist movements, moments, and organizations, foregrounding black
        women’s roles in creating a sustained ideological tradition.\",\"Research

        archaeological investigations on the Menominee reservation in northeastern
        Wisconsin linked the resident population to local prehistoric sites, a construct

        has been historically associated with wild rice harvesting as their Algonquian-derived

        elsewhere, but retained their purported life-ways as hunters and gatherers.

        soil science, oral traditions, agronomy, and geography to construct a new

        were especially targeted for persecution and defined as rebellious. Examining

        crime is dystopian fiction, not contemporary law. Or so we’re told. Yet our
        legal system actually punishes thought regularly, while our legal philosophy
        fails to explain what’s wrong with thought crime or to recognize it for what
        it is. Anglo-American law quietly embraces a style of criminalization where

        crime is in fact just one battle in a larger war, a war fought on terrain
        common to many disciplines in the humanities. It is a war that pits our professed
        commitment to freedom of thought against our often legitimate interest in

        concept which helps identify and navigate multiple worlds of geographic and
        cultural identity formation guides this interactive, web-based, mixed-media

        visual anthropology approach that I have pioneered to reveal some of the multifaceted
        historical, crosscultural and multispecies layers of Florida’s Silver River.
        This born-digital project, which allows for the integration of video, text,
        hyperlinks, audio and graphics, is better equipped to negotiate the representations
        of some of the layers of identity formation that are fragmented, hybrid and

        proposed research is the culminating phase of a monographic project that offers
        a new conceptual model to account for the development and spread of classical
        Hindu law, and in particular of Brahmin authority (both sacred and worldly),
        roughly between 300 BCE and 1000 CE. My analysis shows how the doctrinal ideal
        of the disciplined householder as an ascetic-in-the-world provided a basis
        for treating Brahmin communities as comparable in holiness and authority to
        monastic orders. This principle justified Brahmins receiving patronage in
        the form of tax-free endowments and helped secure their families high social
        status by birth. Over the twelve months of the fellowship, I will finish the
        research and writing of the last three chapters of the book, which deal with
        the appropriation and transformation of this normative model on the peripheries
        beyond the north Indian “middle country”: in the Himalayan hills and Bengal,
        in the Tamil south, and in Indonesia.\",\"Research and writing leading to

        It challenges the dominant analytic framework of empire that has privileged
        the metropole as an imperial center vis-à-vis its colonial peripheries. Taking
        advantage of Taiwan's cultural and geographical proximity to China and Southeast
        Asia, Japanese colonial authorities in Taiwan developed new strategies to
        compete with Chinese and Western powers for hegemony across the East and South
        China seas. Drawing on multi-lingual archives across six countries, this project
        contends that Japanese imperial ideas and practices were not simply dictated
        by the Tokyo central government but also emanated from Taiwan to its neighboring
        regions. It contributes to our historical understanding of the tense geopolitical
        relations in Asia today related to war memories, identities, and nationalisms

        humanities projects have long struggled to find a suitable platform for representing
        pre-modern concepts of space and place. GIS has served as the dominant platform,
        but its core paradigm – that historical data should be layered and often stretched
        (georectified) to fit modern Cartesian cartography – is particularly problematic
        for scholars who study medieval and early modern maps and views. Our solution
        proposes a workflow that integrates GIS, CAD, and the Unity game engine to
        build a malleable mapping environment that forgoes the concept of historical
        layers in favor of linked views that allow simultaneous navigation among original
        sources, modern cartography, and virtual landscapes. Using work already begun
        on a 16th-century Portuguese chorography known as the Book of Fortresses as
        our primary and initial case study, this ”Sandcastle Workflow” proposes a
        method for confronting a range of pre-modern spatial idiosyncrasies that GIS

        1877 and the 1930s, thousands of African Americans migrated to the Great Plains

        or mostly-Black rural communities.” The most important were Nicodemus, Kansas;
        DeWitty, Nebraska; Sully County, South Dakota; Empire, Wyoming; Dearfield,
        Colorado; and Blackdom, New Mexico. These communities survived until the 1930s;

        National laws regulating the movement of one kind of people (immigrants) would
        have affected the movement of others (free black and slaves). The states set

        practices that had been used against free blacks in the antebellum era. To
        justify Chinese exclusion, the Supreme Court ruled in 1889 that federal authority
        over immigration resided in the inherent sovereignty of the nation, rather
        than any particular part of the Constitution. This doctrine has been the basis

        key philosophical innovation was to argue that freedom for women requires
        that they choose what she calls “the neutral life,” foreswearing personal
        and professional relationships. I offer the first systematic treatment of
        Suchon’s philosophical system, showing how it offers new, feminist perspective
        on early modern treatments of human freedom. By placing Suchon in the context

        Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton are rightly depicted as adversaries in the

        support for banking and industry and showed deep skepticism toward democracy.
        \ This project argues that Lincoln serves as a synthesis of Jeffersonian and
        Hamiltonian ideas. Lincoln's thought marries Jefferson's preference for self-sufficient
        labor and natural rights to Hamilton's belief in a national economic policy
        and skepticism of Jeffersonian populism.  Looking at each statesman's views
        on economics, presidential power, war, the Constitution, natural rights, and
        populism we see that Lincoln was able to blend ideas of both founders to build
        better than either intended. As the nature of the founding-era conflicts still

        lines. 2) Rural communities placed greater trust in local leaders than in
        overburdened national authorities. 3) In contrast to modern Europeans’ dependency

        in American literature and culture during the 1950s and the post-Cold War
        era to elucidate the cultural politics of memory on this war. It attempts
        to locate the cultural politics of the war in the very trope of forgetting
        by analyzing assemblies of Korean War representations—which are surprisingly
        numerous, varied, and noteworthy—at two high points of literary and cultural

        times called the “Pearl Age,” the early modern period saw a sharp increase
        in the number of pearls that were fished, traded, and consumed around the
        globe. The discovery of rich pearling beds in the Americas, in particular,
        prompted the emergence in Europe of exquisite artworks featuring pearls and

        focuses on five under-studied artworks hailing from the Atlantic pearl industry

        Specifically, it looks at the discourses they articulated about imperial expansion
        and human mastery over nature, notions of great importance in courtly circles
        linked to the Spanish Crown. Such notions, moreover, helped legitimize the

        the US Civil War, legal recognition of property rights in slaves enabled slaveholders,
        merchants, and investors to buy and sell slaves on credit and to mortgage
        slaves. The US government’s wartime decision to abolish slavery without reimbursing
        slaveowners for the lost value of freed slaves threatened to send this complex
        system of finance, founded on human property, into chaos. From 1864-1871,
        southern and federal lawmakers and judges, as well as everyday southerners,
        argued over who ought to be responsible for the financial burden of emancipation.
        This project explores the little-known history of white southerners’ defense
        of their perceived right to own slaves or to be reimbursed for their value.
        Their debates, ranging from former Confederate states to the US Capital, reveal
        that immediate, uncompensated emancipation in the US South was not an inevitable
        outcome of Union victory in the Civil War, and the process of emancipation

        \ Since the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Americans have been locked in
        a debate over gun control and the meaning of the 2nd Amendment. Perhaps no
        city occupies as significant a place in that debate as Chicago, which has
        a history of terrible violence and stringent gun laws. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme
        Court solidified the city’s crucial place in that debate when it issued a
        landmark ruling in McDonald v. Chicago, which limited American cities’ power
        to regulate guns.   There is no academic, historical study of Chicago’s firearm
        laws. My article addresses this lacuna. [Edited by staff]\",\"Writing an article

        initiatives have presented Shakespeare to American readerships, operating
        on the principle that reading Shakespeare can both catalyze and confirm self-improvement
        and cultural privilege. My thesis is that such middlebrow institutions have
        served as sites where the boundaries of the American public have been contested
        and where demands for fuller public participation by marginalized groups have
        repeatedly been tested. The first three chapters focus on programs that shaped
        the reading public around Shakespeare. The last two chapters suggest that
        Shakespeare’s reading public now emphasizes some of the same constituents

        was newly available to medieval audiences. Chaucer’s poem uses Aristotle’s

        Pindell (b. 1943) confronted expectations of the 1960s and 1970s that African
        American artists represent themselves in their art in a literal way. I argue
        that Pindell investigated how questions about racial and gender difference
        have haunted American modernist visual art in her largely abstract practice.
        Through her use of handicraft and metaphors drawn from black feminist theory,
        she sought to “mend” abstraction, making it useful to her as an artist who
        had experienced de facto exclusion from the category “modernist.” The first
        scholarly monograph on Pindell’s groundbreaking career, this project enriches
        humanistic understanding of twentieth-century American culture, especially
        process-oriented art, by showing how artists of color have been active agents

        left behind modernism’s “art for art’s sake” to embrace a responsibility to
        document the injustices of her time. Although now largely forgotten, Boyle
        was among the foremost chroniclers of the twentieth century's darkest days,
        documenting and analyzing in her fiction the rise of Nazism in Austria in
        the mid-1930s, the fall of France and the internment of innocent refugees
        during WWII, and America's occupation of post-war Germany, which still struggled
        to free itself from fascism. Boyle’s fiction in the 1930s-1940s won her two
        O. Henry Awards for best story of the year and a contract with The New Yorker
        that was severed in 1953 when she was erroneously accused of being a Communist.

        of reasoning and reason-giving. However, the rationalist justification of
        democracy is questioned by two major sources: first, by influential voices
        in late modern Continental political philosophy; second, by recent research
        in the field of American political science. On both fronts, a similar claim
        is made: namely, that liberal democratic political theory has failed to recognize
        that human beings are primarily “rationalizing” beings, rather than “reasoning”
        beings. I believe that political theorists need to take this claim seriously,
        so that we can consider with fresh eyes the question: to what extent are genuinely
        “rational” citizens required in order to have a properly functioning liberal

        The story of the resulting monumental sculptures, commissioned from Greenough

        I relocate these sculptures out of the familiar national context and into
        a complex network of transnational art, aesthetics, and politics. The project
        considers ideal sculptural bodies as agents of political union and white supremacy—concepts
        with equal appeal in Italy during the Risorgimento and in the United States

        is a book-length project in American literary history that examines narrative
        strategies in nineteenth-century U.S. novels. Throughout the 1800s, virtually

        “I” or a “we”\ntelling the tale to the reader. But by the early years of the

        surrounding Albanian communities and adjusted their approach to better fit
        the needs of refugees and communities. Albanian communities and local governments,
        meanwhile, turned to the historic concept of <em>mikpritja </em>(hospitality)
        to understand why and how to help the Kosovar refugees, ultimately motivating
        Albanian families to shelter sixty-six percent of all refugees. This study

        think idolaters believed, why did they think idolaters did what they supposedly
        did, and how did they think idolaters differed from Christians? I argue that
        ancient idolatry polemic produced both the idols spoken of and several assumptions

        religion” existed; that the Bible contains a single, clear concept of idolatry;
        that idolatry is only about the erroneous treatment of images; and that ancient
        Jewish and Christian worship was scrupulously observant of the second commandment.
        A close reading of ancient Jewish, Christian, and “pagan” texts, however,
        shows that these assumptions are as misleading as they are intuitive. The

        from an inward-looking terror state focused on industrial production to a
        superpower that wagered its legitimacy on fulfilling consumer needs at home
        and establishing a formidable global presence abroad. By examining Aeroflot
        as a microcosm of the Soviet system, my project explains the country’s broader,
        sustained growth in the postwar era as the result of the state’s successful
        attempts to create a consumer-oriented, but not consumer-driven economy, propelled
        by technological development, global expansion, and the legitimizing discourse
        of Marxist-Leninist ideology.\",Research and writing of two chapters for a

        priest and Inquisitor Francesco Emanuele Cangiamila. Sacred Embryology is
        one of the most important Enlightenment-era texts on fetal personhood in the
        Catholic world. It inspired more than a century of similar works, abridgements,
        and translations. These works were widely distributed, especially throughout
        Latin America. It also directly influenced the Catholic Church’s position
        on fetal ensoulment, as articulated in Pius IX’s 1869 Apostolicae Sedis. With
        this text, Cangiamila became one of the first theologians—and certainly the
        most vocal of his time—to insist that fetal ensoulment might occur as early
        as conception. We expect that the volume will attract readers and researchers
        from numerous fields, given the work’s significance to Roman Catholic theology,
        gendered scientific practice, and social and legal debates about unborn life.\",Preparation

        discovery of 7,000 burials of Asylum patients beneath the UMMC campus, and
        extensive public call for information about the institutions. We argue that
        the Asylum’s place in professional and lay understandings of mental illness,
        social exclusion and silences in family genealogies, theories and practices
        of early modern healthcare, populations of public psychiatric institutions,
        and post-emancipation racial understanding has been understudied or unknown.

        requests support for the exhibition Diego Rivera’s America, on view October
        24, 2020 – January 31, 2021. Diego Rivera (1886-1957) was one of the most
        aesthetically, socially, and politically ambitious artists of the 20th century.
        His complex compositions on public walls in Mexico and the United States made
        history and shaped history, and directly inspired muralists across the continent
        from the 1930s to today. Diego Rivera’s America is the most in-depth examination
        of the artist’s work in more than two decades. It will provide a new critical
        and contemporary interpretation of his images, whether painted on the wall
        or on the easel. The exhibition will be supported by a scholarly catalogue,
        education programs for students of all ages, and free public programs. Additionally,
        in-gallery interpretive media content will further contextualize Rivera and
        his work.\",Implementation of a traveling exhibition about Diego Rivera’s

        landscapes by British artist John Constable (1776-1837) are often split into
        two phases depending on whether they were made before or after an intense
        period spent observing and painting clouds in 1821-1822. Contemporaries disagreed
        about the effect this interlude had on the realism of his work, and art historians

        historians may have overlooked or been unable to discern. We will also use

        Finding the 1859 Land Grant, which mentions the Iowa Tribe, led HCC to contact
        Alan Kelley of the Iowa Tribe.  Conversations with Alan, then Executive Committee
        Vice-Chair of the Tribe, and Lance Foster current Executive Committee Vice-Chair
        led to the insight of the interconnections of the Iowa Tribe, the Highland

        actual freedom would exist in the United States.  Black troops were at Normandy,
        Iwo Jima, and the Battle of the Bulge.  They fought bravely in combat, and
        they formed the backbone of the United States military’s supply effort, enabling
        the Allies to fight and win a global war.  They did all of this while fighting
        in a segregated military.  Black veterans returned from the war and kept fighting
        white supremacy at home, fueling the civil rights movement.  This history
        is important because more than seventy years later the questions the war raised
        regarding race and democracy remain unanswered. This book tells this inspiring

        a libel suit. As a result, American libel law is the most protective of speech

        The goals of the workshop are to (1) heighten awareness of 19th-century Cherokee
        removal from the Southeastern U.S.; (2) give K-12 teachers the tools they
        need to teach this portion of their social studies and/or history curricula
        effectively; and (3) highlight voices and perspectives from the period – particularly
        Cherokee voices – to tell the story. Participants will visit several key Cherokee
        landmarks and engage with a wide range of museum artifacts, Native American
        art, claims for damages filed by the Cherokees, newspapers from the time period,
        recorded eyewitness testimony, Cherokee myths and stories, and other resources.\",<p>Two

        distorted by rickets. These women could carry a fetus to term, but could not
        give birth naturally. In such cases, obstetricians had three options: to stand
        by as both mother and child died; to save the mother by destroying the fetus
        in utero and delivering it in pieces; or to perform a Caesarean section, which
        was tantamount to a death sentence for the mother. Thus, medical professionals
        were forced to weigh the life of the mother against the life of the unborn
        child, whose value was as yet unknown; and the mother’s own disability was,
        itself, a factor in this calculus. This project explores representations of

        of friendship, and examine cultural/social contexts and factors including

        participants from colleges and universities to the University of Oregon to
        broaden their Asian Studies and World Literature curricula. This seminar focuses
        on early modern vernacular literary works from China and Japan that emerged
        during periods of urbanization and growth of global commercial markets. The
        seminar concentrates on two novels: \"\"Jing Ping Mei\"\" (Plum in the Golden
        Vase; 1590s) from China and \"\"Nanso Satomi Hakkenden\"\" (Eight Dogs of
        the Satomi Clan of Southern Fusa; 1814-1842) from Japan. Both are adaptations
        of an earlier Chinese novel: \"\"Shuihu Zhuan\"\" (Outlaws of the Marsh; in
        circulation by 1541). By focusing on one work from each country that derives
        from the same source, we will sketch a larger picture of the circulation of
        texts, techniques, aesthetics, and the development of vernacular language
        and culture in urbanizing and commercializing societies.\",\"A four-week seminar

        Listening for Africa David F. Garcia explores how a diverse group of musicians,
        dancers, academics, and activists engaged with the idea of black music and
        dance’s African origins between the 1930s and 1950s. Garcia examines the work
        of figures ranging from Melville J. Herskovits, Katherine Dunham, and Asadata
        Dafora to Duke Ellington, Dámaso Pérez Prado, and others who believed that
        linking black music and dance with Africa and nature would help realize modernity’s
        promises of freedom in the face of fascism and racism in Europe and the Americas,
        colonialism in Africa, and the nuclear threat at the start of the Cold War.
        In analyzing their work, Garcia traces how such attempts to link black music
        and dance to Africa unintentionally reinforced the binary relationships between
        the West and Africa, white and black, the modern and the primitive, science
        and magic, and rural and urban.\",No to support statement,Music History and

        Back looks at the international dimensions of abolition in the Atlantic world.
        It traces the kidnapping of freed people across jurisdictions, from Philadelphia
        to St. Domingo or Barbados to Texas. It argues that when black people crossed
        in and out of jurisdictions, and in and out of slavery, it prompted a reckoning
        with what freedom meant. As captives pushed for an end to their bondage abroad,
        they expanded the freedom struggle onto foreign terrain. Remarkably, captives
        could at times enlist high ranking officials as allies. When statesmen in
        Washington D.C. or London responded to freedom suits, they developed conceptions
        of what it meant to be a free subject of an empire. Carried Back demonstrates
        that freedom, and the rights it encompassed, came not just from elite politicians,
        and not only from people who resided within national or imperial borders.

        studies of three major famines that struck North China under governments with

        starving to death is so disturbing, famines generate intense discussion of
        a given culture’s ultimate values.  Yet conceptions of what ethical responses
        to famine entail are neither static nor universal.  China experienced radical
        change between the late-Qing (1800-1912), Republican (1912-49) and Maoist
        (1949-76) periods. I examine how such change impacted state and societal responses
        to the North China Famine of 1876-79, the Henan Famine of 1942-43, and the
        Great Leap Famine of 1958-62.  I find that in twentieth-century China, the
        rejection of long-held cosmological interpretations of famine made it easier

        complex ways the “alternative modernity” of cultural forms in the Global South.
        Given India’s long precolonial history of multilingual literacy and indigenous
        performance, the modernizing force of Anglo-European influences created aesthetic,
        material, and institutional conditions for theatre after 1850 that were historically
        unprecedented and culturally transformative, but still affected by the legacies
        of “tradition.” The new initiatives included the resurgence of classical Sanskrit
        models, print authorship, large-scale translation, anti-commercialism, and
        the formation as well as subversion of a “new national canon” after independence
        (1947-). My project thus delineates the evolving modernity of a major non-Western
        urban theatre field, connecting it to sociocultural shifts in India and to
        vital movements in world theatre.\",\"Research and writing leading of a book

        capital, thus setting in motion the machinery of death. This book investigates
        the history of capital punishment in Senegal from the 1820s to the 1960s by
        exploring the role it played to mete out punishment and to maintain law and
        order. It also analyses its role in citizenship building to unlock the multiple

        the evolution of capital punishment and its impact on the development of the
        colonial state by highlighting the construction of death sentences and what
        it reveals about the French’s concerns with citizenship building. The book

        how lineage organizations emerged as the key institutions in local political
        ecology. Lineages anchored their control of village-level environments to
        graves and shrines. They endowed land to corporations held in the name of
        their ancestors, and used fengshui geomancy to govern the vegetation and landforms
        permitted in discrete segments of the village landscape. Most importantly,
        they used the framework of patrilineal descent to determine who was permitted
        access to shared resources. Far from eternal features of the Chinese environment,
        village landscapes were created through repeated interactions between people
        and their natal soils and waters, flora and fauna, governed by a coherent
        ethics joining kinship and ecology.\",Research and writing leading to a book

        of dishonor, this study suggests that captives were both multivalent and rhetorically
        powerful in Maya art. Based on analysis of the style, iconography, and context
        of over 300 depictions of captured enemies from throughout the Maya area,
        I demonstrate that captives in Late Classic Maya art legitimized royal authority,
        constructed specific social identities, and ensured the maintenance of world
        order through the nourishing power of their bodies. Treating the captive body
        as a cultural project that both shaped and reflected the embodied experiences
        of ancient people, this analysis enables a more robust understanding of Maya
        art by recovering the ways in which carved stone sculptures signified to diverse
        audiences in ancient Maya centers.\",Research and writing leading to a book

        of dêmokratia that was substantively different from later definitions of “democracy.”
        Paradoxical though it seems, he impressed upon his reader the need to analyze
        Athenian democracy as a form of autocratic rule, not as an inherently egalitarian
        regime. In doing so, I show, Thucydides reinvented the traditional ideology
        of heroic kingship, utilizing explanatory tools from Greek science to produce
        an account of a heroic democracy that was at once proto-social scientific
        and indebted to tragic myth. Recognition of this project redefines our understanding

        takes the April 1968 unrest in Trenton, New Jersey as its starting point,

        Around the nation more than 40 people died in what was called the Holy Week
        uprisings, or King riots. Police said many victims were looters or arsonists.
        Trenton’s “riots” became a simplified explanation for the city’s woes. Yet
        there has been little research into the nation’s “scenes of racial violence,”
        as named by the Philadelphia Inquirer. Uprisings centers on Harlan Bruce Joseph,
        a black college sophomore at Lincoln University who was fatally shot by a
        white officer during minor unrest in Trenton. Joseph’s life reveals a committed
        young man interested in the ministry who worked to make a better Trenton.

        a result of COVID-19 and school closings, the Gilder Lehrman Institute of
        American History has rushed to meet the urgent needs of educators, students,
        and parents across the country with free programming. K-12 history classes,
        in particular, have been eliminated or greatly pared back, and summer learning
        loss is expected to be enormous. The Institute has worked intensively to convert
        in-person programs into digital formats and develop new online programs for
        the public. We received positive feedback from thousands of participants,
        proving that we are filling a critical gap. We have made substantial adjustments
        despite known revenue shortfalls of $1M in FY20 and FY21. The Institute anticipates
        more shortfalls, up to 25% of our approximately $10M FY21 budget. Without
        additional funding, shortfalls would likely lead to program reductions, cancellations
        and layoffs. This grant would give us the critical funds for near-term work,
        including reimagining of key programs and staff retention.\",Continued employment

        is to work with Community Archivists from endangered language communities
        to build capacity around methods in archives-based research for community-directed
        revitalization efforts. With this mission in mind, the National Breath of
        Life has developed a model for Native American philology. Since 2011, National
        Breath of Life has expanded the model to increase the depth and breadth of
        training for Native American Community Archivists who are responsible for
        building and maintaining a wide range of language archive activities and research
        specific to the revitalization of their community languages. As part of this
        process, National Breath of Life provides state-of-the-art software and best
        practices to advance their work.    The proposed project builds capacity for
        the National Breath of Life in two strategic areas. First, is the development

        to the editor, trial testimony, books, and speeches produced by viewers in
        response to specific photos they encountered in public. Finnegan treats the
        photograph as a locus for viewer engagement and constructs a history of photography's
        viewers that shows how Americans used words about images to participate in
        the politics of their day. As she shows, encounters with photography helped
        viewers negotiate the emergent anxieties and crises of U.S. public life through
        not only persuasion but action as well. Telling a new story about a medium

        recordings and linked data to enable novel approaches to co-creative use of
        materials in the archival collections of the Institute of Jazz Studies and
        Scottish Jazz Archive. This trans-Atlantic collaboration between jazz historians,
        technologists, and jazz archivists will expand access to unique materials
        held in archives and illuminate their musical relationships to more widely
        studied recordings. This project will create, analyse, and visualize relationships
        between audio and other materials and create rich research workflows to be
        shared within the scholarly community as a novel way to support co-creation
        with cultural institutions. We envision a disciplinary transformation through
        the discovery of new models for jazz historiography, and a broader, interdisciplinary
        transformation in methodology for digital humanities\",\"The development of
        artificial intelligence and music information retrieval tools and archival
        workflows to enhance access to archival jazz collections, including those
