        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S., nearly 500,000 patients
        suffer an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) each year. Most emergency
        departments (EDs) lack the local capabilities to perform primary percutaneous
        coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial reperfusion. Thus, patients must
        be transferred to capable facilities, but inefficiencies in this process cause
        delays in timely myocardial reperfusion and worsen patient outcomes. The time
        to reperfusion for transferred STEMI patients greatly lags behind those patients
        who present directly to PCI centers and fails to meet national benchmark standards
        in 90% of cases. Inadequate measurement and understanding of the timing and
        processes of care at transferring EDs has hindered improvement in the timeliness
        of STEMI patient transfer. Moreover, the study of relational coordination,
        communication, and organizational design, collectively known as \\\"organizational
        behavior,\\\" is an accepted approach to study performance and variation in
        complex health systems. It has not yet been applied to the transfer of STEMI
        patients, but would likely reveal important targets for intervention. This
        proposal describes a career development plan that enables the candidate to
        gain expertise in how organizational behavior affects patient care, through
        the acquisition of advanced qualitative and quantitative skills for future
        implementation studies. The Specific Aims are: 1) Examine transferring ED
        data for factors associated with delays to myocardial reperfusion; 2) Conduct
        a detailed qualitative study of the practices that affect patient transfer
        for primary PCI; and 3) Examine the association between relational coordination
        and time spent at transferring EDs. The candidate is uniquely qualified as
        an emergency physician and PhD candidate in operations management. The career
        development plan builds on this foundation to provide: a) advanced skills
        in qualitative methods (e.g., patient and staff interviewing skills, and observation),
        biostatistics, and organizational theory; b) further development of scientific
        communication skills through manuscript preparation, grant writing, and conference
        presentations; and c) a multidisciplinary mentored research experience with
        international experts in transitions of care, qualitative research, process
        intervention development, and trial design. The institutional environment
        is outstanding, including a qualitative research center; nationally ranked
        graduate programs in the candidate's fields of study; and the national CTSA
        coordinating center. This career development award will allow the candidate
        to develop expertise in measuring the performance of healthcare systems during
        inter-facility patient transfer, a deep understanding of the relationship
        between system performance and patient outcomes, and targets for intervention
        to improve the timeliness of patient care for myocardial infarction. This
        award will position the candidate to become an R01-funded independent investigator
        who implements and evaluates process interventions to improve patient outcomes.\",\"project_title\":\"Enhancing

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nThis NHLBI K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
        Development Award (PA-18-374) submission by\\nAnuj B. Mehta, MD will enable
        him to achieve his overarching career goal of improving shared decision-making\\n(SDM)
        in the intensive care unit (ICU) by combining qualitative research methodologies
        with ‘big data’. Dr.\\nMehta is a Pulmonary and Critical Care Physician at
        National Jewish Health. This award will build on Dr.\\nMehta’s prior health
        services research in delivery science and provide him with protected research
        time and\\nsupport to pursue advanced education and training in 1) qualitative
        research 2) advanced statistical\\nmethodologies in health services research,
        3) SDM, and 4) decision aid development. With this proposal, we\\nseek improve
        SDM for tracheostomy by developing and piloting a personalized decision aid
        (AIM 3) with a\\nqualitative decisional needs assessment through semi-structured
        interviews of surrogate decision-makers (AIM\\n1) and development of tailored
        tracheostomy prediction models (AIM 2). The dramatic increases in\\ntracheostomy
        utilization that we have previously reported has large personal and societal
        implications. Patients\\nwho receive a tracheostomy overwhelmingly require
        long-term hospitalization with significant morbidity,\\nmortality, long-term
        care needs, and caregiver stress. Evidence suggests that there is large patient
        and\\nsurrogate frustration with the decision-making process with significant
        decision conflict, misalignment of care\\ndelivered with patient values, and
        discordance between surrogates’ expectations and actual outcomes. These\\nfindings
        raise the possibility that patients may be receiving unwanted, invasive, and
        expensive care not\\nconsistent with their underlying values. SDM is the collaborative
        process of patients, surrogates, and\\nhealthcare providers reaching an informed,
        collective agreement on the treatments consistent with patient’s\\nvalues.
        Decision aids are a key tool with which to facilitate SDM. SDM and decisions
        have been shown to\\nimprove the patient-centeredness of care, improve patient
        knowledge of treatment options and possible\\noutcomes, better align chosen
        treatments with patient values, and reduce decisional regret and conflict.\\nMultiple
        societies now recommend that SDM be a cornerstone of patient centered care
        in the ICU bit its\\npenetration and uptake are limited. We hypothesize that
        a personalized web based decision aid for\\ntracheostomy will improve the
        shared decision making process. Dr. Mehta has strong institutional support
        from\\nNational Jewish Health. Dr. Mehta has assembled a team of mentors well
        suited to ensuring his success\\nduring this Career Development Award led
        by Dr. Ivor Douglas and Dr. Daniel Matlock. Dr. Mehta’s work will\\nserve
        as model for developing SDM tools in the ICU. Dr. Mehta’s proposed training
        and research will directly\\nimpact patient care related to tracheostomy by
        improving SDM, and better aligning the care received with\\npatient and surrogate
        values.\",\"project_title\":\"Developing a Novel Decision Aid for Tracheostomy

        SUMMARY\\nFor the growing population of adolescents and young adults (AYAs;
        12-24 years) with pediatric heart disease,\\nsurvival comes at a cost due
        to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 14,000 children\\nexperience
        heart-failure related hospitalizations annually. Among this group, 7% die
        during their hospitalization\\n– a mortality rate nearly 20 times greater
        than hat seen in hospitalized children without heart failure and more\\nthan
        double that in adult heart failure. The Institute of Medicine recently highlighted
        a critical need to better\\nunderstand and improve medical decision making
        involvement of AYAs afflicted with serious illnesses across\\ntheir disease
        trajectory and as they approach end of life. Yet, research on the end of life
        and palliative care\\nneeds of the growing AYA heart failure population is
        very limited, despite alarmingly high rates of invasive and\\ncostly interventions
        at the end of life for this group. The current proposal seeks to address gaps
        in research\\nand practice through three specific aims via two separate studies:
        Aim 1) To ascertain the end of life care\\nneeds and preferences of pediatric
        heart failure patients and parents via qualitative descriptive research.\\nQuantitative
        measures of disease severity, health-related quality of life, and trust in
        physician will be used to\\nfurther describe the sample. Aim 2) To describe
        provider communication of prognosis, hope, and advance care\\nplanning (e.g.,
        Do Not Resuscitate, Hospice) topics through audio-recorded conversations with
        AYA cardiology\\npatients and/or their families. A priori hypotheses will
        not be tested for Aims 1 and 2 given their qualitative\\nnature. Themes will
        be determined for future hypothesis-driven research. Aim 3) To develop and
        pilot a\\nprovider-directed end of life care communication intervention. It
        is hypothesized that intervention participation\\nwill lead to increased provider
        use of rapport and partnership building statements and greater physician\\ncommunication
        of prognosis, hope, and advance care planning topics. In addition to these
        three research aims,\\nthe K23 proposal includes a robust four-year research
        training plan. With the support of an interdisciplinary\\nteam of expert mentors
        and advisors, Study PI will gain experiences in qualitative research, pediatric
        palliative\\ncare and bioethics, and randomized intervention trial design
        and statistical analysis. Training goals will be\\naccomplished through didactic
        coursework; mentored studies and frequent interactions with mentors and\\nadvisors;
        and seminars, meetings, conferences and workshops. This K23-supported research
        training and\\nfoundational data will enable Study PI to obtain long-term
        career goals, which include the development and\\nimplementation of an R01-funded

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed pre-doctoral training
        fellowship serves two overarching goals: 1) To enhance my quantitative and
        qualitative research methods skills toward applying for and obtaining a mixed
        methods R01grant; and 2) To apply and refine my public health training by
        conducting a dissertation research project to understand the effect of the
        changing food environment on obesity in a historically low-socioeconomic status
        (SES) community of color undergoing gentrification. Background: Since the
        late 1990s, the neighborhood of Central Harlem in New York City has been undergoing
        dramatic transformation as characterized by gentrification, a mixture of divestment
        and redevelopment. These changes influence the food environment (i.e. grocery
        outlets, restaurants, street vendors, and farmers' markets) and, with it,
        residents' food-related practices and health. Given the high rates of nutrition-related
        conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in Harlem,
        any transformation in its food environment raises the need for investigation.
        The overarching question of my dissertation is: How does the changing food
        environment in Harlem, a neighborhood undergoing gentrification, affect residents'
        risk for obesity mediated by food-related dispositions and practices? Aims:
        The specific aims are to: 1) Examine changes in Central Harlem's food environment
        during 1990-2010 by analyzing the NETS database; 2) Examine whether longitudinal
        changes in the food practices of mothers and children are associated with
        changes in weight measurements and risk for obesity using the Columbia Center
        of Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) cohort data; 2a) Compare changes
        in the weights of mothers and children who have remained in Central Harlem
        and those who have moved from the neighborhood; 3) Use ethnographic methods
        (including participant observation, and in-depth interviews with a sub-set
        of CCCEH participants) and key informant interviews to explore ongoing changes
        in Harlem's food environment, and how these changes affect food practices
        and dispositions, thus corroborating and expanding upon the quantitative findings
        under Aims 1 and 2; and 4) Integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings
        and thus develop a provisional conceptual framework to understand the effects
        of gentrification on obesity as mediated by food practices and dispositions.
        Methods: Consistent with my training objectives, the study will apply an ethnographic
        and sociological framework of habitus to examine the relationship between
        gentrification, habitus and obesity prevalence among residents of a historically
        resource poor neighborhood. Specifically, I will conduct a mixed methods explanatory
        sequential design including three phases: 1) secondary longitudinal data analyses
        of the National Establishments Time-Series database and CCCEH mother-child
        pairs; 2) qualitative data collection and analysis by employing an ethnography
        of Harlem's food environment and interview with 15- 20 key informants and
        45 CCCEH participants; and 3) integration of findings to develop a provisional
        conceptual framework that illustrates the effect o gentrification on obesity
        as mediated by food habitus.\",\"project_title\":\"Gentrification, food environment,

        men who have sex with men (MSM) testing for HIV in the United States (US),
        approximately 60% of all\\nincident HIV infections occur in men reporting
        the highest quartile of risk behaviors. Young MSM (i.e. those ≤24\\nyears
        of age; hereafter “YMSM”) are disproportionately represented in the highest
        risk quartile, have rates of\\nHIV incidence twice as high as older MSM, and
        are less likely to take preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the\\nprevention
        of HIV. As a high-impact prevention strategy, the CDC recommends YMSM test
        for HIV once every\\n3-6 months. Alarmingly, we recently documented risk behaviors
        increased in direct proportion to the number of\\nrepeat negative HIV tests
        among MSM, despite routine risk-reduction counseling. The dynamics behind\\nincreasing
        risk behaviors in repeat testers are poorly understood. Increased risk behavior
        may lead to more\\nfrequent (and appropriate) HIV testing or perhaps more
        frequent HIV testing gives rise to increased risk\\nbehavior (i.e., negative
        test results may be interpreted as positive reinforcement that ongoing risk
        behaviors\\nare not sufficiently risky to result in HIV infection). In either
        case, current public health efforts to increase HIV-\\ntesting in the highest
        risk quartile are likely to capture more YMSM, and studies are needed to delineate
        the\\ndrivers of ongoing or increased risk behavior in YMSM after testing
        to develop more effective interventions to\\npromote HIV prevention. Given
        the push to increase repeat HIV testing among YMSM in the US, gaining a\\nbetter
        understanding of if and how repeat testing influences risk perception and
        risk behavior is\\ncritical. We propose a novel study to assess perceptions
        of receiving negative HIV test results and how\\nthey are associated with
        HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time in YMSM. To explore the\\nattributions
        and „meaning‟ YMSM make of negative HIV test results over time, we will perform
        cross-sectional\\nin-depth qualitative interviews (n=20; phase 1) in PrEP-naïve
        HIV repeat testers receiving negative HIV test\\nresults, followed by quantitative
        assessment and monitoring of patterns of self-reported risk behaviors and\\nperceived
        risk over time (n=115; phase 2) in YMSM. Purposive sampling for the qualitative
        interviews will\\nstratify recruitment by self-reported risk behavior at their
        two most recent testing encounters. Qualitative\\nfindings will be incorporated
        into a validated questionnaire that quantitatively measures psychological
        reactions\\nto the receipt of negative HIV test results. In phase 2 of the
        study, the adapted questionnaire will then be\\ndelivered together with monthly
        microsurveys to assess development of self-reported risk and prevention\\nbehaviors,
        as well as perceptions of HIV-exposure risk before receiving the negative
        HIV test result and over\\n12-months after the testing encounter. The proposed

        SUMMARY\\nIn the United States, firefighters and emergency medical technicians
        (EMTs)/ paramedics respond to more than 50 million\\nemergency calls annually.
        The daily operations and experiences that are expected and accepted as part
        of their job expose\\nthem to various traumatic events (e.g. school shootings,
        suicides). The nature, frequency, and intensity of duty-related\\ntraumatic
        exposures place these first responders (FRs) at significant risk for mental
        health (MH) problems, such as post-\\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
        suicide. However, due to the stigma of mental illness and the culture of self-reliance\\nand
        strength that surrounds FRs, few are willing to seek help. In a preliminary
        study conducted by the Principal\\nInvestigator, community partnerships were
        established with key FR stakeholders throughout Arkansas to discuss MH-\\nrelated
        issues. They unanimously expressed concern about the increased prevalence
        of MH problems and lack of help-\\nseeking among FRs in the state. Hence,
        we propose an exploratory, qualitative study that will use a statewide community-\\nengagement
        approach to conceptualize a MH service model that FRs will be willing to access
        and use. Our specific aims\\nare to: AIM 1) Identify FRs' preferences and
        priorities regarding MH service and delivery methods, including the\\nfeasibility,
        acceptability, and value of each method. To address this aim, we will use
        opt-in methods to recruit a diverse\\ngroup of firefighters and EMTs/paramedics
        from across Arkansas to participate in qualitative interviews, defined as
        focus\\ngroups and individual interviews. After all qualitative interviews
        have been analyzed, we will initiate a series of product\\ndevelopment activities
        to achieve AIM 2) Conceptualize a MH service model, in partnership with FRs
        statewide, that is\\napplicable, acceptable, and feasible for implementation.
        In collaboration with our community partners, and based on the\\npreferences
        and priorities identified by FRs, a hybrid Delphi technique of consensus formation
        will be used to\\nconceptualize a MH service model that is acceptable to FRs
        and feasible to implement in real world settings, which aligns\\nwith the
        National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Priorities (Strategic
        Objective 4.1 and 4.2). Through this\\nwork, we will generate the scientific
        foundation to develop a comprehensive, MH service model that will motivate\\nengagement
        in services by diverse FRs. We expect this model will encompass a range of
        services, such as awareness,\\nprevention, treatment, and crisis management
        strategies to meet FRs' MH needs throughout the course of illness. This\\nstudy's
        findings will guide a multi-stage, research agenda that will include: 1) development
        and pilot testing of the MH\\nservice model (Strategic Objective 4.3), 2)
        a full-scale trial of the program statewide, revised based on pilot results,
        and 3)\\na hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (Strategic Objective
        4.4). Ultimately, promoting engagement in MH services\\nmay decrease suicide
        rates and improve the overall MH outcomes among this at-risk population. With
        continued efforts\\nand partnerships, findings can be integrated into policy
        and funding-related decision making to sustain the delivery of\\nhigh-quality
        MH services for FRs in Arkansas and across the nation.\",\"project_title\":\"Building

        the candidate with the training and mentorship to become an independent behavioral
        scientist with expertise on couple-based approaches to optimize engagement
        in the HIV care continuum (CC) in sub-Saharan Africa. Research on the HIV
        CC in sub-Saharan Africa has largely focused on structural and individual-level
        barriers and facilitators, resulting in a weak understanding of factors at
        the relationship level. A central component of this K01 award is the conduct
        of research on dyadic aspects of engagement in the HIV CC among couples living
        with HIV. The proposed research will be situated in Malawi, a resource-poor
        country in SSA where 11% of adults are HIV-infected and an estimated 8,000
        Malawians die each year from AIDS-related illness. The majority of new HIV
        infections occur within marriage or cohabitating unions. Despite the success
        of ART programs in Malawi, large numbers of HIV+ individuals who are eligible
        for ART and who have initiated ART continue to drop out of the HIV CC. Furthermore,
        as more HIV+ individuals access ART while healthier, there are growing concerns
        about long-term adherence to ART. Using a dyadic, mixed-methods study design,
        the specific aims of the research are: 1) to describe how the relationship
        context influences engagement in the HIV CC within Malawian couples; 2) to
        identify the relationship-level barriers and facilitators that affec engagement
        in the HIV CC; and, 3) to develop a preliminary intervention to optimize engagement
        in the HIV CC for Malawian couples. For Aim 1, qualitative interviews will
        be conducted with 25 couples (50 individuals) with at least one partner who
        is either starting or already on ART. For Aim 2, the qualitative findings
        will be analyzed to develop a survey for 200 ART patients and their primary
        partner. The survey will collect information on relationship dynamics and
        characteristics, treatment knowledge and beliefs, contextual factors related
        to HIV care and treatment, and measures of engagement in the HIV CC (e.g.,
        attendance at clinic appointments, adherence to ART).Medical record data and
        hair specimens will also be collected from respondents on ART to supplement
        self-reported measures of engagement in care. For Aim 3, 20 semi-structured
        interviews with community members and stakeholders, and 4 focus group discussions
        with couples will be conducted to inform the development of a relationship-focused
        intervention targeting optimal use of HIV care and treatment. Through this
        research plan, the candidate will gain practical training in four areas: (1)
        interpersonal theory to understand health behavior; (2) methodological skills
        to collect and analyze dyadic qualitative and quantitative data; (3) healthcare
        and clinical aspects of HIV/AIDS; and (4) behavioral intervention design and
        evaluation. An interdisciplinary team of mentors and scientific advisors will
        support the training and research plan through their combined expertise in
        couples-based research, dyadic data analysis, healthcare and medical management
        of HIV/AIDS, behavioral interventions for HIV/AIDS, and local knowledge of
        the Malawi context.\",\"project_title\":\"Relationship Factors and Engagement

        SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT\\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause
        of cancer death in the US. Despite overwhelming\\nevidence that screening
        reduces both CRC incidence and mortality, less than two-thirds of eligible
        adults are\\nup-to-date with screening. These figures also overestimate the
        proportion of Americans who receive adequate\\nlong-term protection from CRC
        because they are based on one-time, cross-sectional measurements. To\\nensure
        that eligible populations receive maximal benefit from CRC screening, it is
        critical to accurately\\nmeasure adherence to different screening strategies
        over multiple cycles, to identify the various barriers to\\nrepeated screening,
        and to translate this information into effective interventions that can be
        implemented\\nrapidly and efficiently. This K08 proposal will address the
        following three specific aims: (1) Quantify longitudinal\\nadherence to screening
        colonoscopy and FOBT/FIT in the national VA database over a 15-year period;
        (2)\\nIdentify social and contextual barriers and facilitators to longitudinal
        adherence using a qualitative approach in\\nveterans who are due for repeat
        screening/surveillance colonoscopy at an urban VA hospital; and (3) Assess\\nthe
        feasibility of a pilot bidirectional text messaging intervention on attendance
        for screening/surveillance\\ncolonoscopy and bowel preparation quality. This
        will be the first study to compare longitudinal adherence to\\nscreening colonoscopy

        sexual behaviors have high personal, social, and financial costs. While family
        communication about sex\\ncan reduce these behaviors, most studies focus on
        a single time point. However, early (10-13), middle (14-17)\\nand late (18-21)
        adolescence each brings distinct developmental and relational processes. To
        be effective,\\nconversations about sex need to fit with teens' developmental
        stage and experiences. Protective resources are\\nparticularly important during
        late adolescence as this period is characterized by sexual experimentation
        and\\nrisk-taking, and shows high levels of sexually transmitted diseases
        and unintended pregnancies. Few studies\\nassess family sexuality communication
        during late adolescence, a period which often involves separation from\\nparents
        but also growing mutuality with them, particularly for girls, which may create
        new opportunities for\\nteen-parent communication. Various characteristics
        affect how a person perceives parent-teen conversations\\nabout sex: 1) teen
        gender, 2) the gender match between teen and parent, and 3) whether one is
        the parent or\\nthe teen. For example, parents share different messages with
        daughters than sons about sex, but the influence\\nof teen gender can be confounded
        by the match in gender between the teen and parent, which is unexplored.\\nFinally,
        parents and teens frequently view family sexuality communication differently,
        but what lies behind\\nthese differences is unexplored. Research is needed
        to guide parents as to whether and how to talk with their\\nchildren about
        sex in ways that are relevant for and accessible to teens at different developmental
        stages,\\nparticularly late adolescence. To address NICHD's goals of identifying
        factors for preventing unintended\\npregnancy and reducing transmission of
        STDs, the proposed study provides a rare opportunity to longitudinally\\nexplore
        continuity and change in family sexuality communication over three critical
        developmental stages of\\nadolescence (Aim 1). It will also compare how characteristics
        of teen gender, the gender match between the\\nteen and parent, and teen and
        parent agreement across topics shape family communication about sex and\\nrelationships
        (Aim 2). To address these aims, this study uses a longitudinal qualitative
        design, extending\\nexisting qualitative data on teen-parent sexuality communication
        when teens were in 7th and 10th grade (N=23\\nparents and 23 teens) by conducting
        a third wave of interviews during late adolescence with the same sample\\nof
        diverse families. Thematic analysis will be used to examine interview data.
        Given its qualitative focus, this\\nstudy is largely exploratory. However,
        it is expected that female late adolescents will be more likely to talk with\\nparents
        about sex than males and that higher teen-parent agreement in reported talk
        about sex will be\\nassociated with positive perceptions of family sexuality
        communication (Aim 2). This study is significant as the\\nfirst in-depth,
        longitudinal examination of teen-parent sexuality communication over three
        key adolescent\\nperiods. Results will provide recommendations for parents,
        health providers, and educators on how to support\\nteens' health by adapting
        sexuality communication across multiple stages of adolescence.\",\"project_title\":\"Teen-parent

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K08
        award for Sunitha Kaiser, MD MSc, a pediatric hospitalist at the University
        of California, San Francisco. Dr. Kaiser is establishing herself as a young
        investigator in accelerating use of evidence-based guidelines in clinical
        practice to improve quality of hospital care for children, an AHRQ priority
        population.\\nThis award will provide Dr. Kaiser with the support necessary
        to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become expert in qualitative research
        methods and implementation science; (2) to gain experience in conducting a
        trial; (3) to gather preliminary data for the purpose of designing a multi-site
        trial; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve
        these goals, Dr. Kaiser has assembled a multi- disciplinary mentoring committee
        whose expertise spans the relevant disciplines of asthma and clinical trials
        (Drs. Cabana, McCulloch and Horwitz), health services research (Drs. Auerbach,
        Cabana, McCulloch, and Horwitz), qualitative research (Dr. Rehm), and implementation
        science (Drs. Auerbach, Cabana, and Horwitz). Asthma is the second most common
        cause of pediatric hospitalizations1 in the United States, resulting in nearly
        $1 billion in annual costs. Despite broad dissemination of evidence-based
        guidelines for asthma management, there are significant variations in care
        and risk-adjusted outcomes for children hospitalized with asthma, largely
        due to challenges integrating guidelines into care. Clinical pathways are
        structured, multidisciplinary, and detailed care plans for patients with a
        specific clinical problem; they link evidence to practice to optimize patient
        outcomes and delivery efficiency. In controlled trials, pathways reduce inappropriate
        variation in care and improve outcomes for children hospitalized with asthma
        by both increasing home asthma management education and decreasing hospital
        length of stay. However, there is wide variability in performance and uptake
        of pediatric asthma pathways in real-world settings due to a dearth of evidence-
        based guidance on successful implementation methods. Dr. Kaiser's long-term
        goal is to become an independent investigator who leads efforts to improve
        quality of care for hospitalized children by accelerating use of evidence-based
        guidelines in clinical practice. Dr. Kaiser's objective is to identify, test,
        and disseminate best practices for pathway implementation to improve quality
        of care for children hospitalized with asthma. The central hypothesis, derived
        from the \\\"positive deviance\\\" approach, is that identification and examination
        of hospitals that demonstrate exceptional performance with pathway implementation
        can facilitate the discovery and wide dissemination of strategies to improve
        care. Steps in this mixed-methods approach include: 1) identify hospitals
        where pathway implementation led to the largest gains in performance, 2) study
        these hospitals using qualitative methods to identify best practices associated
        with high performance, and 3) test these best practices with rigorous design.
        The rationale is that high-performing hospitals will have replicable pathway
        implementation practices that will be critical to widespread national uptake,
        ultimately leading to\\nconsistent delivery of evidence-based practices and
        higher quality of care. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific
        aims: Aim 1) Identify hospitals where implementation of inpatient pediatric
        asthma pathways has led to the largest improvements in quality of care. Key
        personnel from 43 children's hospitals that contribute to a national administrative
        database will be surveyed to determine if and when asthma pathways were implemented,
        then the database will be used to identify which hospitals had the greatest
        gains in quality of care with pathway implementation. Aim 2) Determine best
        practices for implementation of inpatient pediatric asthma pathways through
        in-depth qualitative analysis of key personnel from the high-performing hospitals
        identified in Aim 1. Aim 3) Conduct a pilot trial to determine the feasibilityof
        implementing inpatient pediatric asthma pathways utilizing best practices
        in both a tertiary and community hospital setting. This pilot trial will enroll
        50 total children hospitalized with asthma The proposed research is innovative
        to pediatric clinical pathway research both by shifting the traditional approach
        to focus on implementation strategies and by utilizing a novel mixed-methodology,
        based on the concept of \\\"positive deviance.\\\" The proposed research is
        significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand knowledge
        on best practices for pathway implementation, which will enable increased
        uptake and successful implementation of clinical pathways in both tertiary
        and community settings, thereby improving evidence-based practices and quality
        of care for children with asthma. Ultimately, this new knowledge could support
        pathway implementation across a range of pediatric illnesses to improve quality
        of care and decrease unnecessary costs.\",\"project_title\":\"The PIPA (Pediatric

        to evaluate the impact of\\nmarijuana policy changes on patterns of use of
        marijuana and other harmful substances among\\npeople living with HIV (PLWH).
        PLWH are a key population given their high prevalence of\\nmarijuana use and
        potential for marijuana-related adverse outcomes. We will analyze the rich\\ndata
        available through the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical
        Systems\\n(CNICS) study, a large, geographically and racially diverse cohort
        of >32,000 PLWH in care in 8\\nregions across the U.S. CNICS' comprehensive
        clinical data includes laboratory data (CD4, HIV\\nRNA levels), medications,
        diagnoses (substance use disorders, mental health disorders),\\npatient-reported
        outcomes (PROs) with >70,000 comprehensive substance use assessments,\\nand
        health care utilization such as primary care visits and missed visits. Ongoing
        longitudinal\\nsubstance use assessments combined with geographic diversity
        including areas like San Diego,\\nSeattle, and Boston with recent regulatory
        changes and areas like Baltimore and Birmingham\\nwithout regulatory changes
        will enable this project. We will examine marijuana use among\\nPLWH using
        joint longitudinal and survival models to estimate associations with\\npolicy/regulation.
        We will also evaluate the association between marijuana use changes and risk\\nbehaviors,
        such as binge drinking, among PLWH. We will additionally employ qualitative\\nmethods
        including focus groups and structured interviews to evaluate changing usage
        patterns,\\nbeliefs, and health behaviors over periods experiencing regulatory
        changes. We expect that the\\nmajority of increases in marijuana use will
        be explained by current users increasing frequency\\nrather than non-users
        becoming users. Furthermore, post-legalization, PLWH reporting current\\nmarijuana
        use will a) describe a diversification of product use and means of ingestion,
        b) report\\nincreased access to marijuana, c) describe an increase in use
        of marijuana in social settings\\nand in public spaces, d) report marijuana
        as a cue for use of other substances in certain\\nsettings, e) describe decreased
        stigma associated with marijuana use, and f) and lower rates of\\nalcohol
        and tobacco use. The findings of this proposal will likely enable several
        future studies\\nexploring the intersection of marijuana policy, substance
        use, and health outcomes among\\nPLWH. Further, we expect that data gleaned
        from this project will have ramifications not only for\\nthe clinical care

        \  \\r\\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol misuse and smoking constitute
        two of the three leading preventable causes of death in the United States.
        Reluctance to treat tobacco dependence among those with AUD is misguided as
        recent research suggests smoking cessation treatment can be effective, does
        not increase risk of relapse to alcohol, and may even improve rates of sobriety.
        There is strong evidence for the short-term efficacy for alcohol misuse and
        smoking of contingency management (CM). It is an intensive behavioral therapy
        that provides incentives (vouchers, money) to individuals misusing substances
        contingent upon objective evidence from drug use. Implementation of CM has
        been limited because of the need to verify abstinence multiple times daily
        using clinic based monitoring. Our group recently developed a smart-phone
        application which allows a patient to video themselves several times daily
        while using a small CO monitor and to transmit the data to a secure server
        which has made the use of CM for outpatient smoking cessation portable and
        feasible. Our mobile CM (mCM) approach paired with cognitive-behavioral counseling
        and pharmacological smoking cessation aids has been effective in reducing
        smoking. Thus, the purpose of this project is to develop and pilot-test a
        combined alcohol and smoking mCM intervention. Our long term goal is to develop
        mCM procedures that will be used as part of a multi-component intervention
        to concurrently and effectively treat both alcohol misuse and smoking. As
        part of this project, we will develop a multi-component telehealth alcohol
        and smoking mCM intervention. It will include mCM, cognitive-behavioral phone
        counseling, and standard smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. Three cohorts
        will provide data. The first cohort (n = 5) will yield primarily qualitative
        data from participants and therapists, which will be utilized to modify the
        treatment components including the therapist manual, participant workbook,
        mCM apps, and data collection procedures. The second cohort (n = 5) will yield
        qualitative and quantitative data to guide the focus of the intervention to
        components most valued by participants and linked with achieving outcome benchmarks.
        The third cohort will be a pilot clinical trial comparing the multi-component
        mCM intervention (n = 30) to a comparison condition (n = 15) that differs
        only in that reinforcement will not be contingent on abstinence. The work
        proposed in these aims will provide the first step toward implementation of
        an innovative approach that builds upon the power of mHealth technology to

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION: In Africa, HIV prevention has been most successful with
        women, not men. For example, young, South African men aged 18-29 years continue
        to have a high incidence of HIV, frequent drug use, low HIV testing rates,
        concurrent sexual partnerships, and low rates of HIV testing and utilization
        of medical care. Innovations are needed in how, when, and where we engage
        men in HIV prevention. With R34 funding, we successfully demonstrated the
        feasibility of engaging young men with soccer and vocational training to reduce
        drug use. We randomized two neighborhoods to either: an intervention (soccer
        and vocational training contingent on behaviors at soccer); or a delayed-delivery
        control neighborhood. Almost all eligible neighborhood men were recruited
        (95%; N=142) and 90% reassessed at 6 months. In the intervention condition,
        80% of young men regularly attended soccer and 55% earned entry to vocational
        training. Intervention men completed drug tests at soccer (with uptake rising
        over time and drug use decreasing), and increased employment over six months,
        compared to control men. HIV testing did not increase, based only on self-reports.
        Qualitative interviews of men, coaches, and family members demonstrated the
        program's benefits in shifting men's role in their homes and communities,
        although attitudinal shifts towards women were minor.  Based on these results,
        a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is proposed to test the efficacy of randomizing
        all young men in a neighborhood to receive: 1) soccer training (8 neighborhoods,
        400 men); 2) soccer and vocational training (8 neighborhoods, 400 men); or
        3) a control condition (8 neighborhoods, 400 men). The primary outcomes will
        be decreased substance use (tested with rapid diagnostic tests [RDT]), increased
        repeat HIV testing (linkage, retention, and adherence to medical care among
        HIV-infected men), no concurrent partnerships, increased condom use, and no
        violence/arrests. Stellenbosch University interviewers will conduct assessments
        at recruitment, 6, 15, and 24 months (using mobile phones). Coaches will implement
        a Life Skills manual, as well as integrating cognitive-behavioral skills into
        problem situations that arise at games/practices, and reporting in real time
        via mobile phones all intervention contacts and content. Qualitative interviews
        will be conducted with coaches and young men (n=30 at each 6 month interval).
        If the RCT is successful, global program diffusion is probable by the Fédération
        Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) with national funding by the
        South African government NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) vocational
        training program, whose annual funding is typically underspent.\",\"project_title\":\"HIV

        Summary/Abstract\\nSepsis is a life-threatening condition that has doubled
        in incidence over the past decade, and now constitutes\\n17% of all in-hospital
        deaths in the US at an annual cost of $24 billion. Early, aggressive emergency
        care\\nsaves lives, yet many rural hospitals have low adherence to evidence-based
        sepsis care guidelines.\\nConsequently rural sepsis patients have a 38% higher
        mortality rate. Rural emergency department (ED)-based\\ntelemedicine has been
        proposed to standardize care and support local clinicians in rural hospitals,
        but its\\neffectiveness has never been rigorously tested. With 19% of the
        US population living in rural areas and an\\nestimated 5,000 preventable rural
        sepsis deaths annually in the US, there is a critical need to test strategies
        to\\nimprove dissemination and implementation of evidence-based sepsis guidelines
        in rural centers. The goal of\\nthis Career Development Award is to prepare
        the applicant for a career as a clinical investigator and health\\nservices
        researcher focusing on comparative effectiveness research of rural acute care
        interventions. This goal\\nwill be accomplished within the infrastructure
        of the Rural Telehealth Research Center through (a) specific\\ngraduate coursework,
        (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee, (c) carefully selected conferences and\\nworkshops,
        and (d) a mentored research study. The specific aims of the proposed study
        are (1) to measure the\\nassociation between ED-based telemedicine use, guideline
        adherence, and clinical outcomes, (2) to measure\\nthe effect of a telemedicine
        relationship on guideline adherence among patients who have telemedicine\\navailable
        but not used, and (3) to describe how and why telemedicine use affects clinical
        care, decision-\\nmaking, and dissemination of best practices, using qualitative
        methods. The proposed mentored research\\nproject will accomplish these aims
        through an observational cohort study of patients with severe sepsis or\\nseptic
        shock treated in critical access hospitals in a large Midwestern telemedicine
        network over a 4-year\\nperiod. Our central hypothesis is that telemedicine
        will improve clinical outcomes through improved adherence\\nwith international
        sepsis guidelines by changing (1) patient-level recommendations, (2) provider-level
        behavior,\\nand (3) hospital-level practices. At the end of this Career Development
        Award, the candidate will be well-\\nprepared to become an independent scientist
        with expertise in rural acute sepsis care, with specific strength in\\ncomparative
        effectiveness research methods and qualitative methods. Our study findings
        will serve as the\\nbasis for future studies to understand the role of dissemination

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nHypertension (HTN), which affects nearly 80 million U.S.
        adults and costs society approximately $80 billion\\nannually, is the leading
        modifiable cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Current guidelines recommend
        a\\nstandard systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goal of <140 mmHg in
        most patients. The Systolic Blood\\nPressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed
        a 25% reduction in CVD events with intensive SBP treatment\\n(<120 mmHg) in
        high CVD risk adults. However, intensive SBP treatment likely requires additional
        health\\ncare resources and practice changes so it will be challenging to
        implement in real-world settings.\\nThis project proposes to: (1) build and
        validate a “hybrid” hypertension treatment simulation model to\\ndetermine
        the cost-effectiveness of intensive SBP treatment in a population-based sample
        of SPRINT-eligible\\nU.S. adults, (2) incorporate local data from diverse
        health systems into the hybrid blood pressure model to\\ncompare the cost-effectiveness
        of intensive SBP treatment implementation strategies, (3) engage local\\nstakeholders
        in study design and communication strategies, and (4) disseminate results
        to local and national\\nstakeholders to optimize intensive SBP treatment implementation.
        The central hypothesis is that intensive\\nSBP treatment implementation in
        health systems will be feasible and cost-effective in high CVD risk\\npatients
        compared to standard treatment even when considering local implementation
        factors.\\nMost past research using computer simulation methods generates
        “average” national population estimates and\\nthe models are often considered
        opaque “black boxes” by decision makers. This project is innovative as it\\napplies
        simulation methods to the local health system level, using local patient data,
        and engages local\\nstakeholders to address practical implementation barriers
        and facilitators. For intensive SBP treatment,\\nthis may result in more efficient
        and safer implementation, while also reducing the burden of CVD attributed
        to\\nraised SBP.\\nMy career goal is to become a principal investigator and
        expert focused on the use of computer simulations to\\nimprove healthcare
        delivery, quality, and population health. The proposed career development
        plan will\\nprovide training and mentorship in: (1) advanced computer simulation
        methods; (2) analysis of\\nindividual-level data from clinical trials, observational
        cohorts, national surveys, and health systems;\\n(3) qualitative methods;
        and (4) dissemination and communication of computer simulation research\\nresults.
        This training will be achieved through coursework, hands-on experience, and
        active mentoring. The\\nmentoring team is comprised of nationally recognized
        experts in hypertension, clinical trials, computer\\nsimulation, cost-effectiveness

        (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Steffani Bailey has her PhD in clinical
        psychology and is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Family
        Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. Dr. Bailey has conducted lab-based
        studies on craving processes, and directed two randomized clinical trials
        for smoking cessation in community- based populations. She has 19 peer-reviewed
        publications, with 9 as first author. Dr. Bailey's previous research experience
        in smoking cessation, the training activities proposed in the K23 application,
        and her multidisciplinary team of mentors, will provide her with the expertise
        and guidance necessary to become an independent investigator in primary care
        smoking cessation research with underserved populations. Research Focus: Electronic
        health records (EHR) are increasingly being used to prompt health care providers
        to assess and treat tobacco use, as well as to document that these services
        were rendered. The United States Congress passed legislation (\\\"meaningful
        use\\\" of EHR) that could increase the use of the EHR for both assessing
        smoking status and providing cessation assistance in clinics serving Medicaid
        and Medicare patients. EHRs can aid in the ability to track the progress on
        selected indicators and can be utilized in research to identify important
        information about subpopulations that are less likely to\\nbe getting the
        standard of care for tobacco use treatment. Although research has shown that
        EHR use does increase the number of unique patients asked about smoking status,
        research is mixed on whether use of this technology increases rates of quitting
        advice or smoking cessation. The study will use quantitative data from OCHIN,
        a multiple-facility, linked EHR provider, and qualitative data from clinic
        observations and interviews with health care providers and patients. This
        mixed-methods study will 1) evaluate whether implementation of Stage 1 Meaningful
        Use of EHRs for smoking indicators, which includes changes to the EHR vital
        signs section, increases rates of assessing smoking status and readiness to
        quit, and smoking cessation assistance, 2) identify patient, provider, and
        clinic characteristics associated with rates of smoking assessment and delivery
        of cessation services, and 3) identify factors that promote and hinder smoking
        cessation treatment in primary care settings through clinic observations and
        interviews with both health care providers and patients. This research will
        inform the development of a primary care-based smoking cessation intervention
        that utilizes health information technology, as well as develop Dr. Bailey's
        career in primary care research focused on underserved populations. Training
        goals: Dr. Bailey's training goals include 1) developing an advanced understanding
        of facilitators and barriers to the assessment and treatment of smoking in
        federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs), including use of health information
        technology, 2) increasing her knowledge of health disparities in underserved
        populations, 3) developing skills in qualitative methodology and mixed methods
        research, including advanced biostatistical analysis. Environment: Dr. Bailey
        will undergo her career development in the Department of Family Medicine at
        Oregon Health & Science University, an organization with significant and longstanding
        resources for early-career researchers. She has strong institutional and departmental
        support. Methods: Using EHR data from 21 FQHC primary care clinics, and random
        effects Poisson regression, Dr. Bailey will evaluate whether implementation
        of Stage 1 Meaningful Use increases the rates of assessing smoking status
        and readiness to quit, and providing smoking cessation assistance (Aim 1).
        Using 2014 EHR data from 69 FQHC primary care clinics, she will conduct logistic
        generalized estimating equation regression analyses to examine associations
        between patient, provider, and clinic-level characteristics and rates of the
        assessment and treatment of smoking (Aim 2). Finally, using qualitative methods,
        she will identify facilitators and barriers to smoking cessation treatment
        in FQHCs. She will collect this data through patient and provider interviews
        and observations of clinics with the highest and lowest rates of smoking cessation
        assistance (Aim 3). Outcomes: These results will aid in determining whether
        resources being invested in the meaningful use of EHR are producing any measurable
        changes and how they might need to be improved. Findings from this study can
        inform policy and clinical practices, particularly in primary care settings
        that provide services to underserved populations with higher than average
        smoking rates. Results from this study will inform the design of a future
        intervention for smoking cessation in FQHCs that will be proposed in an R01
        application during the latter years of the award period.\",\"project_title\":\"Meaningful

        have designed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to test an intervention
        for a population seldom\\nstudied―hospice family caregivers―targeting an identified
        need (decision-making), and measuring a core set\\nof caregiver outcomes (anxiety,
        pain knowledge, and patient pain). This innovative proposal will be the first\\nshared
        decision making intervention in the hospice setting. This project proposes
        an intervention for hospice\\nfamily caregivers called ACCESS (Access for
        Cancer Caregivers to Education and Support for Shared\\ndecision-making).
        Our preliminary work (R01NR011472) found that it is feasible to use web-based\\nconferencing
        to facilitate family caregiver attendance at the hospice care plan meetings.
        Qualitative feedback\\nindicates this attendance is beneficial to family members.
        However, we conclude that simply enabling\\nattendance at these meetings is
        not sufficient to change clinical outcomes. For caregivers anxiety to be\\nchanged
        they need to be prepared for these encounters and actively engaged with the
        hospice staff in shared\\ndecision-making. There is a critical need to arm
        Hospice family caregivers with necessary information and a\\nstrengthened
        their emotional state so they may become decision-makers. We propose using
        the Facebook\\nplatform to improve emotional support and caregiver knowledge
        to better prepare caregivers for participation\\nand decision-making. The
        proposal is based on a conceptual model that combines collaboration with shared\\ndecision-making.
        A pragmatic randomized controlled trial (P-RCT) design will randomly assign
        subjects to one\\nof three groups: 1) Group 1 will serve as the control and
        receive usual hospice care enhanced by hospice staff\\ntraining in shared
        decision making, 2) Group 2 is one intervention group and will receive usual
        care as well as\\nparticipate in a private Facebook support group to increase
        their knowledge and social/emotional support, 3)\\nGroup 3 will receive enhanced
        usual care, participate in the Facebook support group, and participate in\\nhospice
        team meetings with a shared decision making process. We will use qualitative
        and quantitative\\nmethods in parallel and equal status to measure the efficacy
        of the intervention. Our overall hypothesis is that\\nACCESS will improve
        hospice cancer family caregiver knowledge (via YouTube videos) and emotional
        state\\n(via Facebook), facilitating a shared decision making process, which
        will result in improved caregiver anxiety\\nand knowledge and improved pain
        control for patients. We have three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the effect\\nof

        The currently quality measures for VTE have important flaws that limit\\nthe
        ability of hospitals to identify actionable targets for quality improvement

        have designed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to test an intervention
        for a population seldom\\nstudied―hospice family caregivers―targeting an identified
        need (decision-making), and measuring a core set\\nof caregiver outcomes (anxiety,
        pain knowledge, and patient pain). This innovative proposal will be the first\\nshared
        decision making intervention in the hospice setting. This project proposes
        an intervention for hospice\\nfamily caregivers called ACCESS (Access for
        Cancer Caregivers to Education and Support for Shared\\ndecision-making).
        Our preliminary work (R01NR011472) found that it is feasible to use web-based\\nconferencing
        to facilitate family caregiver attendance at the hospice care plan meetings.
        Qualitative feedback\\nindicates this attendance is beneficial to family members.
        However, we conclude that simply enabling\\nattendance at these meetings is
        not sufficient to change clinical outcomes. For caregivers anxiety to be\\nchanged
        they need to be prepared for these encounters and actively engaged with the
        hospice staff in shared\\ndecision-making. There is a critical need to arm
        Hospice family caregivers with necessary information and a\\nstrengthened
        their emotional state so they may become decision-makers. We propose using
        the Facebook\\nplatform to improve emotional support and caregiver knowledge
        to better prepare caregivers for participation\\nand decision-making. The
        proposal is based on a conceptual model that combines collaboration with shared\\ndecision-making.
        A pragmatic randomized controlled trial (P-RCT) design will randomly assign
        subjects to one\\nof three groups: 1) Group 1 will serve as the control and
        receive usual hospice care enhanced by hospice staff\\ntraining in shared
        decision making, 2) Group 2 is one intervention group and will receive usual
        care as well as\\nparticipate in a private Facebook support group to increase
        their knowledge and social/emotional support, 3)\\nGroup 3 will receive enhanced
        usual care, participate in the Facebook support group, and participate in\\nhospice
        team meetings with a shared decision making process. We will use qualitative
        and quantitative\\nmethods in parallel and equal status to measure the efficacy
        of the intervention. Our overall hypothesis is that\\nACCESS will improve
        hospice cancer family caregiver knowledge (via YouTube videos) and emotional
        state\\n(via Facebook), facilitating a shared decision making process, which
        will result in improved caregiver anxiety\\nand knowledge and improved pain
        control for patients. We have three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the effect\\nof
        ACCESS on hospice FCGs anxiety, pain knowledge, and patient pain; 2) Evaluate
        the effect of social\\nmedia as a decision aids and decision support for pain

        to incarceration for non-violent drug\\noffenders in the U.S. Presently there
        are more 3,000 Drug Treatment Courts operating nationwide. These\\ncourts
        take a collaborative, non-adversarial, team approach uniting the judge, prosecution
        and defense\\nattorneys with substance abuse treatment professionals to facilitate
        effective drug treatment and related\\nservices (e.g., education, employment
        training), to eligible offenders who would otherwise be sentenced to jail\\nor
        prison. Nearly three-quarters of persons assigned to treatment in the general
        criminal justice system never\\nenter treatment or leave treatment prematurely
        which makes the work of the DTCs especially critical.\\nHowever, while DTCs
        have been shown to reduce costs to the overall criminal justice system and
        to society at\\nlarge, recidivism within the drug treatment court system continues
        to be a problem.\\n Live InspiredLLC was established in 2006 to deliver a
        daily recovery-oriented TxM to subscribers, and has\\nsince expanded to offer
        daily messages from over twenty different programs. In 2009, we participated
        in a pilot\\nproject to develop recovery-oriented text messages for individuals
        sentenced through a DTC. Results\\ndemonstrated that DTC participants responded
        favorably to these messages, which were used by the\\npresiding judge as an
        incentive for completing specific program requirements.\\n For the proposed
        study, we will fully develop and implement an interactive text messaging intervention\\nsystem
        for individuals newly sentenced in drug treatment court, a period during which
        they are expected to\\nbegin addressing underlying issues related to their
        addiction, and during which time they are highly vulnerable\\nto relapse and
        noncompliance with mandated activities. Participants will complete surveys
        at baseline and be\\nrandomly assigned to receive 30-days of daily supportive
        text messages (TXS) in addition to their usual care,\\nor a treatment as usual
        control (TAU). After day 30 in addition to collecting survey data, we will
        interview\\nparticipants to obtain more detailed qualitative data about their
        experiences with the courts, and (if in the TXS\\ngroup) their experiences
        with our program. Outcomes include compliance with Court-mandated appointments,\\nabstinence

        and obese smokers are disproportionately at risk for disease, disability,
        and premature death but may be\\nreluctant to give up smoking due to the fear
        of subsequent weight gain and trouble managing their weight without\\ncigarettes.
        Applying weight gain prevention as part of a multiple health behavior change
        (MHBC) program prior to\\nsmoking cessation, can help overweight and obese
        individuals lose weight and buffer against post-cessation weight gain.\\nAchieving
        some degree of success with behavioral weight loss may result in decreased
        negative affect, increased future-\\noriented decision-making, and increased
        self-efficacy to manage weight and change smoking with great potential impact\\non
        subsequent smoking cessation outcomes. The current proposal will develop this
        MHBC intervention for treatment-\\nseeking overweight and obese smokers and
        qualitative focus group data and data from an open series of patients to refine\\ntreatment.
        Next, a small 2-group randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted
        with 60 overweight or obese\\nsmokers (BMI ≥ 25) assigned to either weight
        gain prevention (an intervention based on self-regulation approaches to\\nproduce

        8\\nweeks of weight gain prevention or lifestyle education followed by 8 weeks
        of cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking\\ncessation with combination nicotine
        replacement therapy. Smoking cessation counseling sessions will include brief\\nmaintenance

        with an initial primary focus on\\nobesity, (2) implementing the stage model
        of treatment development for clinical behavioral therapy research including\\nqualitative
        methodology for therapy development, (3) learning advanced statistical techniques
        for analyzing longitudinal\\ndata in clinical trials, and (4) strengthening
        professional research career development skills. Preliminary efficacy data\\nobtained

        SUMMARY\\nStroke is the leading cause of adult-onset disability; however,
        treatment of the locomotor dysfunction that usually\\nresults has been limited.
        Individuals who experience a stroke often continuously and inadvertently contract
        their\\nmuscles due to changes in how the brain coordinates movement, among
        other mechanisms. This extra muscle\\ncontraction causes unwanted resistance—known
        as increased joint stiffness and viscosity. Patients must fight\\nagainst
        this resistance during locomotion, and consequently, locomotor function is
        severely impaired. To treat\\nthe resulting gait deficits, clinicians use
        coarse, qualitative assessments performed while the patient is relaxed\\nand
        their leg is not bearing weight. Although treatments based on these assessments
        have had some success\\nin reducing altered limb mechanics in resting conditions,
        these improvements have not extended to functional\\nbenefits in locomotion.
        Thus, current clinical practice is hindered by the coarse, qualitative nature
        of the\\nassessment metrics, as well as the mismatch between passive assessment
        and the desired improvements in\\ndynamic activities, such as walking.\\nDespite
        much knowledge of joint stiffness during resting conditions, scientific and
        engineering challenges have\\nprevented the study of these properties during
        gait, where they could be used to inform clinical treatment. Over\\nthe past
        several years, our group has overcome these challenges, pioneering a new approach
        to measure the\\nstiffness and viscosity of the ankle dynamically during locomotion.
        We previously quantified how these properties\\nvary during walking in able-bodied
        individuals, which led to the development of a new class of ankle prostheses.\\nAlthough
        we have begun to study how ankle stiffness and viscosity change throughout
        walking in healthy\\nindividuals, there is a gap in our knowledge of how pathology
        alters these properties during locomotion, and how\\nthis knowledge can impact
        clinical treatment. Joint stiffness and viscosity are especially important
        in assessment\\nof individuals post-stoke because these properties directly
        characterize the unwanted resistance that occurs.\\nThe specific objective
        of this proposal is to leverage our innovative approach to investigate how
        ankle joint\\nstiffness and viscosity vary during walking in individuals post-stroke,
        and compare these data to existing\\nassessments and age-matched control subjects.
        Our rationale is that knowledge of how these properties change\\nthroughout
        walking will provide new, fundamental information that can be used to understand,
        assess, and treat\\nthe functional aspects of altered joint mechanics. Our
        hypothesis is that joint stiffness and viscosity will be greater\\nin individuals
        post-stroke, when compared to healthy, age-matched control subjects. This
        work will provide a\\nnew understanding of impaired walking mechanics, and
        provide a novel, quantitative method to dynamically\\nassess and track the
        changes that occur following neural injury. Finally, the information from
        this study can be\\nused to quantify the effect of future targeted physical
        and pharmacological interventions, as well as the\\ndevelopment of novel assistive
        technologies.\",\"project_title\":\"Quantification of dynamic ankle mechanics

        patient-reported outcomes and practical functional measures as metrics of
        response to\\nfuture therapies. This approach addresses critical gaps in the
        conduct of myositis clinical trials: (1) Poor subject\\nrecruitment that geographically
        disenfranchises many myositis patients; (2) Lack of relevant patient-reported\\noutcomes
        as a response metric to available therapies; and (3) Paucity of practical
        functional measures to\\nlongitudinally assess outcome in myositis patients
        with muscle weakness. Our goal is to establish a national\\ncohort of myositis
        patients without geographic restriction using state-of-the-art technology
        (smart phone mobile\\napplications and the web) coupled with tele-medicine
        techniques (tele-research) and to validate: (1) patient-\\nreported metrics
        of PROMIS-physical function and (2) quantifiable metrics of functional outcome
        from physical\\nactivity monitors. Specific Aim 1 will establish the superiority

        trials by enlisting the support of commercial laboratories for bio-specimen\\ncollection
        and mobile research units for drug delivery and trial monitoring activities.
        In addition, we have\\nincorporated rigorous qualitative analysies to understand

        test the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of physical activity monitors
        as a novel\\nfunctional and objective outcome measure in future myositis trials
        and Specific Aim 2b will address the\\nreliability, validity, and responsiveness
        of PROMIS-physical function computer adaptive testing and the\\nefficiency
        gained over the current patient-reported measures employed in myositis observational
        studies and\\nclinical trials. The University of Pittsburgh Myositis Center
        has an excellent track record of successful\\nobservational studies and clinical
        trials and our preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility, capability,

        project has 4 specific aims. We\\nseek to: 1) examine how ELSI concerns are
        addressed throughout the implementation of the WISDOM\\ntrial via ethnography
        and key informant interviews with stakeholders. 2) elucidate the experience
        and\\nmeanings of risk-based screening for trial participants and their primary
        care providers (PCPs) via\\nqualitative interviews with women stratified by
        risk level, focus groups with PCPs, and a survey of the full trial\\ncohort.
        3) explore the consequences of receiving a positive result for one of the
        nine high penetrance\\ncancer susceptibility genes via observations of genetic
        counseling sessions, qualitative interviews at two\\ntime points, a survey,
        and focus groups with WISDOM study breast health specialists. 4) convene an
        Ethics\\nWorking Group that offers advice to WISDOM stakeholders in real time.
        Research across all the aims will\\nbe guided by an overarching theme: the
        intersection of precision genomics and known cancer health\\ndisparities.
        The outcomes of this project will inform the Precision Medicine Initiative,
        particularly efforts to\\nimprove cancer surveillance and early detection.\",\"project_title\":\"Precision

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute respiratory failure requiring
        mechanical ventilation affects over 750,000 patients each year. Mortality
        in this group is high, ranging from 30 to 40%. Recent data suggest that interprofessional
        care practices, such as the Awakening, Breathing, Coordination, Delirium and
        Early Mobility/Exercise bundle (ABCDE) can improve patients' outcomes, specifically
        length of mechanical ventilation and ventilator associated-events. Yet these
        practices are inconsistently applied. One of the main barriers to ABCDE delivery
        is interprofessional teamwork. Interprofessional teamwork is defined as having
        multiple different professionals working together to deliver care. In this
        way, ABCDE serves a model system to examine interprofessional teamwork - focusing
        on who is part of the team (structure) and how the team works together (function).
        The overall goal of this project is to understand how ICU interprofessional
        team structure and function influence high quality care. By understanding
        who is part of the ICU interprofessional team and how the team works together
        for complex care delivery, interventions can be better targeted to the influential
        team of clinicians to improve complex care delivery, provider safer patient
        care. We take a novel approach to examine interprofessional team structure
        using network analysis combined with qualitative methods to examine interprofessional
        team function in 2 ICUs with high ABCDE delivery and 2 ICUs with lower ABCDE
        delivery. Our study has 3 Specific Aims: 1) measure the variability of interprofessional
        team structure for mechanically ventilated patients using network analysis;
        2) describe how the ICU interprofessional team functions within the context
        of ABCDE delivery and 3) examine the relationship between ICU interprofessional
        team structure, ABCDE and duration of mechanical ventilation and ventilator-associated
        events. Completion of these Aims will advance our knowledge of the relationships
        between ICU interprofessional team structure and function and how it influences
        quality care - leading to actionable targets to improve interprofessional
        teamwork and complex care delivery. This will also provide a platform for
        the career development of the primary investigator, Deena Kelly Costa PhD,
        RN. This project builds on Dr. Costa's past training in quantitative methods,
        including network analysis but extends it in 2 essential areas: (1) qualitative
        methods; (2) theories of organizational change and implementation science.
        The research project, highly experienced multidisciplinary mentorship team
        and unparalleled research environment are ideally suited to address the career
        goals and educational needs of Dr. Costa. This career development award lays
        the groundwork for Dr. Deena Kelly Costa to perform ongoing innovative health
        services research and to become an independent investigator and national leader
        in ICU interprofessional teamwork research; to ultimately improve ICU interprofessional
        teamwork and implementation of complex care delivery, leading to improved
        survival and outcomes in this high-risk patient group.\",\"project_title\":\"The

        surgery is advocated for most children with hypospadias to prevent potentially
        serious cosmetic\\nand functional problems. Parents faced with a decision
        about hypospadias repair encounter an irreversible\\nchoice with potentially
        lifelong consequences. Recent studies have identified decisional conflict
        (DC) and\\ndecisional regret (DR) as a significant problem for parents. Several
        recent guidelines on complex urologic\\ntopics suggest that shared decision-making
        (SDM) is the optimal approach. Therefore, I propose to improve\\nSDM and the
        care of hypospadias patients by developing an evidence-based decision aid
        (DA). My\\nhypothesis is that a DA developed for use with parents of hypospadias
        patients will facilitate the SDM process\\nthereby decreasing DC and DR. Furthermore,
        studies assessing DR suggest that family variables, rather than\\nsurgical
        variables, are most strongly associated with DR after hypospadias surgery.
        As such, it is imperative\\nthat we shift our assessment from surgeon- to
        patient-centered outcomes to improve patient/parent\\nsatisfaction. Therefore,
        I also propose to identify patient-centered outcome measures, which emphasize
        what\\nis important to patients with hypospadias as they mature and their
        parents. This study aims to (1) Utilize\\npatient-centered design research
        methods to explore the parental decision making-process regarding\\nhypospadias
        repair and outcomes of importance to parents; (2) Assess qualitatively providers'
        attitudes about\\nSDM and use of a DA for hypospadias; (3) Create a DA and
        postoperative outcome measurement tool for use\\nby parents; and (4) Conduct
        a pilot test of the DA in the clinical setting and a psychometric assessment
        of the\\npatient-centered postoperative outcomes measurement tool. My long-term
        career/research goal is to become\\nan independent investigator with the skills
        to help parents make more informed decisions about hypospadias\\nsurgery and
        objectively measure its long-term outcomes from a patient/parental perspective.
        Additionally I plan\\nto apply this methodology to other urologic genital
        procedures. I hope to develop a fuller understanding of how\\nwe can effectively
        provide parents with optimal decision support and assess our postoperative
        outcomes using\\na parent-centered approach. My career development aims addressed
        in this proposal include (a) Developing\\nproficiency in qualitative research,
        including patient-centered design research methods, (b) Improving delivery\\nof
        pediatric urology services through the development and use of decision support
        tools and patient/parent-\\ncentered outcomes research, and (c) Understanding
        the ethical implications of SDM research. I will complete\\nthis work under
        the mentorship of Dr. Aaron Carroll and a multidisciplinary team with expertise
        in health\\ndecision sciences, pediatric urology and qualitative research.

        Abstract\\nBackground: Attrition of participants is a critical concern for
        investigators conducting HIV prevention\\nintervention studies with people
        who inject drugs (PWID) and their intimate partners. Eastern Europe and\\nCentral
        Asia, the only region globally where HIV incidence and mortality is still
        increasing among PWID, is a\\ncrucial setting for HIV prevention and treatment.
        Kazakhstan has one of the largest numbers of PWID in the\\nworld with an incidence
        rate of HIV that has grown precipitously in recent years. The HIV epidemic
        is\\nconcentrated among PWID and their sexual partners in Kazakhstan. The
        growth of HIV among PWID through\\ndrug risk behaviors has fueled transmission
        of HIV to sexual partners and has resulted in rapid expansion of\\nthe HIV
        epidemic. Rigorous HIV prevention intervention studies for PWID that incorporate
        couples in\\nKazakhstan are crucial to attenuating the HIV epidemic in Central
        Asia. Research suggests that criminal justice\\ninvolvement (CJI)—i.e., arrest,
        detention and incarceration—is a barrier to PWID being retained in HIV\\ninterventions
        and accessing HIV and drug services and treatment. PWID in Kazakhstan have
        especially high\\nrates of CJI, impacting approximately 90% of PWID. No studies
        to date have examined the impact of CJI of\\nPWID and their intimate partners
        on attrition in behavioral HIV prevention intervention studies. To address\\nthese
        gaps, this application has two research aims: 1) To examine relationships
        between CJI and attrition,\\namong PWID and their intimate partners and 2)
        To examine dyadic relationships between partners' CJI and\\nattrition during
        the study period. Methods: This dissertation study uses a sequential explanatory
        mixed\\nmethods approach with 1) secondary data from Project Renaissance,
        a study of 300 male PWID plus their\\nfemale partners who were randomized
        to a 5-session Risk Reduction (RR) or Wellness Promotion (WP)\\nintervention
        arm and re-assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months and 2) primary qualitative follow-up
        data with PWID\\nand their intimate partners to inform findings from the secondary
        data analysis. Analysis: The Actor-Partner\\nInterdependence Model (APIM)
        using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) will estimate the effects of CJI
        on\\nattrition after adjusting for potential confounders (AIM 1 and 2). The
        analytic framework provided by APIM is\\nan innovative method of identifying
        patterns within dyads of how PWID and their intimate partners' CJI shape\\nattrition
        in relation to each other within a single model (AIM 2). Primary data collection
        and qualitative analysis\\nwill enrich statistical findings from the APIM
        using SEM. The 2-year research and training program proposed in\\nthis NRSA
        (F31) Fellowship application will cultivate skills in mixed-methods research
        that are essential to\\ncompleting my dissertation research and training and

        with\\nend of life. Escalations in opioid prescribing for CNCP over the past

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early obesity puts children at
        increased risk for adult obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), early mortality,
        and other risks relative to normal weight children. Most parents of obese
        children are not concerned about their child's weight, and parents grossly
        underestimate the probabilities that their child will be obese and develop
        CVD in adulthood. Parents of obese children who have enrolled in obesity treatment
        programs cite a desire to improve their child's long-term health as a reason
        for engaging in behavior change. Concern about a child's health may be an
        important facilitator for behavior change engagement. Therefore, we are interested
        in understanding ways to promote accurate understanding of children's long-term
        health risks in order to raise an appropriate level of concern about obese
        children's weight and increase uptake of healthful behaviors. Health care
        providers are essential to help parents understand whether their child is
        on a healthy weight trajectory, but providers do not have effective tools
        for talking to parents about obesity and its associated adverse health risks;
        BMI growth charts alone are insufficient. This proposal's overall research
        goal is to identiy clinic-based risk communication approaches that can motivate
        parents of obese children to engage in behavior change to prevent future obesity
        and CVD. In Aim 1, we will develop novel risk communication messages. We will
        consider several novel approaches around message content and framing, but
        primarily, we propose using microsimulation models to forecast a child's long-term
        health risks, based on his age, race, gender, BMI, and family history of CVD.
        Qualitative interviews with providers and parents, and a stakeholder panel
        comprised of health researchers and parent research partners, will be used
        to evaluate potentially effective and acceptable messages. In Aim 2, we will
        experimentally evaluate the efficacy of four novel risk communication messages
        on parental behavior change willingness and intent using a national web-based
        survey. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the acceptability and effectiveness
        of new risk communication messages in a clinical setting, and we will observe
        the impact of new messages on behavior change activities. A survey will assess
        parent-perceived risks, perceived message accuracy, concern about child health,
        and anxiety. This research plan is part of a K01 proposal designed to provide
        scholarly training, mentorship, and support for Dr. Wright to gain skills
        and experience needed to conduct research on how improved obesity-related
        risk communication messages may affect child behavior change. Dr. Wright is
        a decision scientist whose career goal is to become an independent investigator
        with a focus on using decision science methods to motivate uptake of childhood
        obesity treatment and behavior change. To achieve this objective, she will
        pursue training in: (1) the psychology of medical decision making and principles
        of pediatric risk communication, (2) qualitative research methods, and (3)
        the design, implementation, and evaluation of behavioral health interventions.

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA modification, and N6 methyladenosine
        (m6A) in particular, is a newly discovered epigenetic mechanism in the adult
        brain that is has recently been shown to be highly dynamic and, as indicated
        by our preliminary evidence, appears to be involved in fear-related learning
        and memory. The overarching goal of this research program is to establish,
        for the first time, a causal relationship between the epitranscriptomic regulation
        of\\ngene expression and the formation and maintenance of memory in a preclinical
        model of fear-related anxiety disorder. We can then capitalize on this information
        to design better treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by
        impairments in cognitive function. Successful completion of these experiments
        also has the potential to dramatically change the way we think about mechanisms

        SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT\\nHeart replacement therapies (i.e., heart transplants and
        left ventricular assist devices) can improve advanced\\nheart failure patients’
        morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. However, these therapies are associated
        with both\\nhigh risks and potentially high rewards. An advanced heart failure
        patient’s path to receiving heart replacement\\ntherapies is dependent on
        3 critical steps: (1) referral to an advanced heart failure center, (2) clinical
        evaluation\\nat the center, and (3) case review by a multidisciplinary selection
        committee. This pathway is heterogeneous\\nacross the country leading to both
        underuse and overuse of therapies. There is an urgent need to study where\\nand
        why these variations in use exist and to implement solutions that reduce unwarranted
        variations in care.\\nThe rationale that underlies the proposed research is
        that if we can understand the factors that lead to\\nvariations in heart replacement
        therapies at each of the three critical steps, we can develop standardized\\nprocesses
        to ensure that heart failure patients who are most likely to benefit from
        these therapies have access\\nto them, and those who are unlikely to qualify
        can move quickly to other treatment approaches most suited to\\ntheir needs
        and preferences. This career development award includes three complementary
        aims. Aim 1 will\\nquantitatively assess the degree of geographic variation
        at each of the three steps using Medicare claims and\\nthe Dartmouth Atlas
        hospital referral regions. Aim 2 will qualitatively assess reasons for variation
        by performing\\ncritical reviews of selection meetings and stakeholder interviews
        at advanced heart failure centers that are\\nchosen based on findings from
        Aim 1. Aim 3 will use Delphi panels to rank factors contributing to unwarranted\\nvariation
        and propose potential solutions to reduce variation. A deeper understanding
        of variations in heart\\nreplacement therapy use coupled with expert-vetted
        proposed solutions for the leading problems will result in a\\nR01 intervention
        trial that will address one or more of the modifiable factors and will help
        reduce unwarranted\\nvariations in use of heart replacement therapies. The
        applicant, an advanced heart failure cardiologist,\\nproposes a five-year
        career development program to complement the research proposal. This incorporates\\nclose
        mentoring with Drs. Larry Allen (primary), Dan Matlock, and Fred Masoudi,
        nationally-renowned\\ncardiovascular outcomes researchers with expertise in
        advanced heart failure, claims data, qualitative\\nresearch, and shared decision-making.
        The candidate has built productive relationships with her mentors with\\nfour
        published manuscripts and two in progress and has a supportive institutional
        environment. To supplement\\nher prior Masters in Public Health training,
        the candidate has developed a detailed didactic plan that includes\\ntraining
        in Medicare claims data use, geographic analyses, qualitative methodology,
        and dissemination and\\nimplementation science. The candidate’s long-term
        goal is to improve equitable, judicious, patient-centered\\nuse of heart replacement
        therapies for patients with advanced heart failure. The proposed research,
        which\\nserves as a key first step towards the applicant reaching her long-term
        goal, is significant because it will fill the\\nexisting gaps in knowledge

        SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT\\n Candidate. I am a psychology post-doctoral research and
        clinical fellow with the Massachusetts General\\nHospital Cardiac Psychiatry
        Research Program. I hold a PhD in clinical health psychology and a master
        of\\nhealth science (MHS) degree in epidemiology. I have first- or co-authored
        26 peer-reviewed publications\\nfocusing on individual, group, and community-based
        strategies for physical activity and nutrition promotion,\\nobesity and chronic
        disease prevention, and the intersection of mental and physical health. My
        short-term\\ncareer goals are to develop and refine my clinical research skills
        with a focus on physical activity promotion. I\\nplan to develop the skills
        I need to lead a clinical research program by pursuing this K23 award. This
        award\\nwould support my long-term career goals by providing me with the skills
        to become an independent researcher\\nfocused on developing novel interventions
        to promote physical activity for chronic disease prevention. If the\\nproposed
        intervention proves successful, it will provide data to pursue future research
        using this intervention,\\nthereby building the evidence base for patient-oriented
        multilevel physical activity interventions.\\n Career Development. I will
        develop this intervention based on relevant theory, patient input, and expertise\\nfrom
        my mentorship team: Dr. Jeff Huffman (clinical research, positive psychology),
        Dr. Elyse Park (qualitative\\nresearch, motivational interviewing), Dr. Anne
        Thorndike (metabolic syndrome, environmental interventions),\\nand Dr. Brian
        Healy (biostatistics). My team consultants, Dr. I-Min Lee (physical activity,
        measurement) and Dr.\\nLisa Quintilliani (community-based research, dissemination
        and implementation) will provide further expertise\\nto support my training
        goals and research plan. The intervention development, testing, and dissemination\\nprocess,
        along with relevant coursework, seminars, and workshops, will support my four
        training goals: 1)\\ndeveloping analytic skills for qualitative, clinical,
        and multilevel data, 2) becoming an expert in metabolic\\nsyndrome risk and
        prevention, 3) learning cutting-edge and technology-based physical activity
        and sedentary\\nbehavior measurement, and 4) dissemination and implementation
        of research findings.\\n Environment. I will conduct this project at Massachusetts
        General Hospital (MGH), a Harvard Medical\\nSchool teaching hospital, using
        its extensive resources for training and supporting clinical researchers and\\nperforming
        top-quality research. The MGH Cardiac Psychiatry Research Program (CPRP),
        my current\\nresearch group, will be the primary setting for this award. Led
        by my primary mentor, Dr. Huffman, the group\\nhas performed numerous health
        promotion trials in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The\\nCPRP
        is actively enrolling participants for five trials, including an NHLBI-funded
        R01 treatment development\\ntrial of positive psychology and motivational
        interviewing in cardiac patients. I will recruit patients from two\\nprimary
        care clinics that are actively engaged in research. I will also collaborate
        with the MGH Behavioral\\nMedicine Service, a large research and clinical
        program that aims to develop and validate behavioral\\ninterventions for individuals
        with medical illness. The MGH Clinical Research Program and Harvard Catalyst\\nprograms
        will also support my proposed project with clinical research consulting services,
        seminars and\\ncourses on the responsible conduct of research, IRB preparation,
        and using HIPAA and research-compliant\\nelectronic data capture software.\\n
        Research development and design. The overall aim of this project is to develop
        and test a behavioral\\nintervention to increase physical activity among patients
        with metabolic syndrome (MetS) who are insufficiently\\nactive. MetS affects
        about 34% of US adults and is comprised of five cardio-metabolic risk factors
        that are\\nstrongly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes,
        cardiovascular disease, and related mortality.\\nPhysical activity plays a
        key role in preventing progression from MetS to these diseases, but a majority
        of\\npeople with MetS risk factors do not meet physical activity recommendations.\\n
        The goal of this project is to identify insufficiently active primary care
        patients with MetS risk factors and\\nhelp them increase their physical activity
        by creating a multilevel intervention addressing targets at the\\nindividual,
        social, and environmental levels. This project will develop and test a combined
        positive psychology\\nand motivational interviewing intervention in a group
        setting and have participants complete a neighborhood\\nwalkability assessment.
        I plan to follow the NIH-supported ORBIT model for health behavior change\\nintervention
        development to create the intervention in three phases: 1) qualitative research
        and intervention\\ndevelopment (N=20), 2) a feasibility pilot trial and intervention
        refinement (N=16), and 3) a small randomized\\ncontrolled trial (N=64). The
        specific aims are to sequentially develop the intervention and test its feasibility,\\nacceptability,
        and preliminary clinical impact. The hypotheses are that this intervention
        i) will be feasible and\\nacceptable, and ii) that patients in the intervention
        group will increase their physical activity, positive emotions,\\nand related
        health behaviors, more than an enhanced usual care control group.\\n This
        study’s aims will address important research gaps by systematically, iteratively
        developing a multilevel\\n(individual, social, and environmental) physical
        activity intervention customized for MetS. Each study aim\\naddresses one
        or more of my training goals and allows me to use the breadth of resources
        available at MGH\\nand Harvard to become proficient in leading clinical trials
        that have a public health impact.\",\"project_title\":\"Testing the feasibility

        \  \\r\\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \\r\\nPapilledema - a specific
        type of optic nerve edema associated with elevated intracranial pressure -
        occurs in veterans due to intracranial masses or hemorrhage, obstructive hydrocephalus,
        following traumatic brain injury, and from idiopathic causes. Currently, the
        diagnosis of papilledema and its severity are assessed by direct funduscopic
        observation or digital fundus photographs using a six-stage grading scale.
        The scale is qualitative, categorical, subject to inter-rater variability,
        requires clinical expertise, and does not distinguish papilledea from other
        causes of optic nerve edema. Recent developments in the automated image-analysis
        of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images have led to the availability
        of continuous quantitative measures (such as the total retinal volume) of
        edema severity. However, optical coherence tomography is still too expensive
        to become readily available outside specialized ophthalmology clinics. Use
        of low-cost portable color fundus cameras is a more economically viable imaging
        option in telemedical and emergency settings, but there currently exists no
        objective method of analyzing and classifying the cause and severity of optic
        nerve edema. The overall objective of this project is to develop automated
        color-fundus-photograph-based image-analysis strategies to rapidly and accurately
        determine the severity of optic nerve edema and to ascertain features that
        differentiate its cause. The central hypothesis is that, through the use of\\r\\noptical-coherence-tomgraphy-based
        severity measures as a reference standard for computer-based learning of color-fundus-photograph
        features, the ability to automatically estimate the severity of optic nerve
        edema in telemedical settings (where only color fundus photographs are likely
        to be available) will be improved. The rationale for the proposed research
        is that having automated methods for determination of the severity and cause
        of optic nerve edema from fundus photographs will enable earlier diagnosis
        of vision- and life-threatening conditions in telemedical and emergency settings
        in veterans. The following specific aims will be pursued:  1. Develop and
        evaluate the automated methodology for computing swollen-optic-nerve-head-
        \ relevant features from color fundus photographs. This will be completed
        by refining and augmenting  automated fundus-image-analysis approaches for
        computation of global/regional vascular, textural, and  optic-disc boundary
        features in patients with optic nerve edema. The relevance of these features
        will first  be evaluated in this aim via their associations with expert\\r\\ndefined
        severity rankings.  2. Identify features from color fundus photographs that
        optimally correlate with OCT-based  measurements of severity in patients with
        optic nerve edema and develop a fundus-photograph-  based continuous severity
        scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to  relate
        global/regional fundus-based features to recently developed novel automated
        OCT-based  measures of severity (e.g., the total retinal volume). It is expected
        that fundus-based severity measures  using the developed automated approach
        will better correlate (than expert-defined Frisén scale grades -  the current
        clinical fundus-based ordinal severity scale) with OCT-based measures of severity.
        \ 3. Identify features from color fundus photographs that differentiate papilledema
        from other causes  of optic disc swelling and develop a predictive classifier.
        The working hypothesis is that regional  differences around the optic disc
        will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach
        is innovative because the use of automated image-analysis algorithms for assessing
        the extent and cause of optic nerve edema in low-cost images reflects a significant
        department from the status quo of relying on qualitative information. The
        proposed research is significant because it will help to establish much- needed

        (provided by applicant):    \\nAs many as 80% of Veterans with the hepatitis
        C virus (HCV) engage in harmful drinking. This is a major health challenge
        given that even light and moderate alcohol consumption can worsen the course
        and consequences of HCV and can be a barrier to receiving antiviral therapy.
        In response, the VA Uniform Mental Health Services Package has made it a priority
        that HCV and other ambulatory clinics provide evidence-based mental health
        services to all Veterans engaging in harmful drinking within two week (but
        preferably the same day as the clinic visit). Our CREATE partners, the VA
        Office of Mental Health Services, VA Operations (10N), and the VA Office of
        Public Health, are strongly committed to achieving this standard throughout
        the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). However, the cost and organizational
        challenges to meeting this mandate in HCV clinics are enormous, but may be
        surmountable through the use of self-directed technology that minimizes demands
        on scarce staff time.  The primary objective of this study is to implement
        and evaluate a web-based brief alcohol intervention (BAI) for treating Veterans
        with HCV and seeking care at two VA HCV clinics - Veterans Affairs Palo Alto
        Health Care System (VAPAHCS) and San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center
        (SFVAMC). This study will have three aims: First (Aim 1), we plan to assess
        patient, provider, and system factors that may impact the initial adoption
        of this intervention in two VA HCV clinics. These data will result in the
        development of a protocol for the initial implementation of the web-based
        BAI at our two study sites. A secondary aim will involve obtaining patient
        and provider feedback on an existing web-based BAI (see www.bmi-aft.org, VA
        Intranet Only) to help inform its redesign for use with this population. Second
        (Aim 2), we will implement and examine the effectiveness of a web-based BAI
        in two HCV clinics to reduce alcohol consumption in Veterans with HCV at three-
        and six-months post-treatment. Third (Aim 3), we will conduct a budget impact
        analysis to estimate the short-term costs (1-3 years) of adoption and diffusion
        of the web-based BAI and the trajectory of health care spending for study
        participants.  This mixed-methods study will utilize qualitative and quantitative
        methods to achieve its three primary aims. To address aim 1, qualitative interviews
        will be used to collect data that will inform the initial implementation and
        re-versioning of a web-based BAI for use in two HCV clinics located at the
        Palo Alto and San Francisco. To address aim 2, we will use a randomized, hybrid
        (type 1) design with patient level clinical outcome data and formative evaluation
        data collected to examine the effectiveness of the web-based BAI. \\\"Hybrid\\\"
        designs also integrate formative evaluation into experimental designs to identify
        factors that impact the effectiveness of implementation efforts. Formative
        evaluation (e.g., site visits, clinic observatio, and interviews with staff
        and patients) will be used to improve the adoption of the web-based BAI at
        both sites and to provide evidence-based guidance to our CREATE operational
        partners for nationwide implementation. To address aim 3, we will conduct
        a budget impact analysis to estimate the short-term costs (1-3 years) of adoption
        and diffusion of the web-based BAI and the trajectory of health care spending
        for study participants. We plan to collect several types of utilization data,
        including outpatient, inpatient, and pharmacy utilization, and calculate total
        dollars spent for each type of health care utilization for the 6 months before
        and after treatment using DSS cost data.\",\"project_title\":\"Web-based Intervention

        (provided by applicant):    \\nAnticipated Impact for Veterans: Alzheimer's
        disease and the isolation it produces imposes a heavy burden on informal caregivers
        (CG) of Veterans who are persons with dementia (PWD); caregiver research indicates
        that dementia CG carry greater burden than for other chronic diseases. The
        proposed Story-Call intervention will deliver personalized problem-solving
        support in the form of story-telling to expand the reach of VA support resources
        via a mobile phone application (APP) to caregivers of community-dwelling Veterans
        who are PWD. The expected outcomes will examine if CGs find that the APP-recorded
        stories decrease perceived CG burden and increase social support as efficacy,
        while confirming feasibility in recruitment, acceptability, practicality,
        increased adaptation to dementia care, and use of community resources. Background:
        Support programs promoting CG involvement can significantly delay Veteran
        institutionalization as can increased community engagement and early use of
        community-based services. Interventions reducing CG stress and other burdens
        can increase CG quality of life and can decrease costs of the disease. However,
        not all CG reach out to community and nationally-available resources, keyed
        to issues of work, time, culture, or rurality. Mobile technology allows providers
        to reach people who may be isolated and need social support. Project Objectives:
        Aim 1: Quantitative: In a feasibilty study of a randomized controlled trial,
        assign two cohorts to use the APP to record and rate stories, complete validated
        pre-/post-tests, and select from the APP's expanded responses [cases (n=40)]
        or to receive Internet-delivered informational materials including short vignettes
        and a follow-up phone call [control (n=40)] to measure differences in CG burden
        as a primary outcome, and involvement, social support, dementia knowledge,
        and satisfaction with APP use for trends. Aim 2: Qualitative: Using constructivist
        grounded theory, categorize themes from stories and in 2 phases collect: 1)
        perceptions from follow-up phone interviews with CG participants; and 2) focus
        groups with Advisory Group and VA stakeholders as a process evaluation of
        APP appeal, use, impact, and cultural tailoring. Aim 3: Mixed Methods Analysis:
        In the tradition of a fully integrated mixed methods study, integrate the
        parallel quantitative and qualitative findings to evaluate the potential feasibility
        elements of acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, adaptation,
        integration, expansion, and limited efficacy of Story-Call in its potential
        to improve CG burden and suggest directions for a future randomized controlled
        trial across the VISN Methods: Our initially-targeted audience consists of
        working caregivers, particularly minority and rural caregivers, who may have
        less time and opportunity for more traditional, scheduled group support and
        teaching interventions. Using a wait-listed, within/between subjects pre-/post-design,
        this proposed mixed methods study will use the mobile APP to enhance the well-being
        of all VA CG, particularly minority working CG. It is expected to decrease
        perceived CG burden, increase use of community services, and potentially decrease
        CG costs through delay in institutionalization. Building on story-telling
        interventions effective in other chronic diseases, his feasibilty study proposes
        Story-Call as a newly-developed mobile phone application that records, archives,
        and presents 30/60-second videos by caregivers and professionals, who share
        brief stories about how they have handled common dementia home-care situations,
        such as \\\"She wants to go home!\\\" In preliminary data, our successful
        proof-of-concept study of the technology demonstrated that brief training
        enabled four working CG to access our application on the mobile phone, to
        record their own success stories about caring for a spouse/parent, to view
        and rate others' stories and to offer additional responses as a way to decrease
        CG burden and enhance CG well-being. Brief interviews and test scores identified
        high satisfaction with the APP intervention, and suggested that measuring
        outcomes via the APP for caregiver burden will be possible. We propose this
        feasibility study to establish the basis for future testing and implementation.\",\"project_title\":\"Story-Call:

        of naive and memory T cells provides vital protection against both novel and
        previously-encountered pathogens, and loss or dysregulation of these populations
        has catastrophic implications for health. However, while we have qualitative
        knowledge of the signals that inﬂuence T cell division and survival, we\\nlack
        an integrated understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the sizes and
        T cell receptor (TCR) diversities of T cell compartments. Solving this `immuno-ecology`
        problem, and developing validated, quantitative models of the dynamics of
        our T cell repertoires, will give a basis for therapies in many areas; reversing
        the collapse in TCR diversity with age, which may impair responses to vaccines
        and infections; aiding T cell reconstitution following bone marrow transplants;
        treating dis- orders that disrupt homeostasis, such as leukemia's and HIV
        infection; and designing vaccines that boost immunity without impairing T
        cell memory to other pathogens. The goals of this project are (i) to fully
        characterize the rules governing the incorporation of new cells from the thymus
        into our naive T cell pools, identify age-related heterogeneity in naive T
        cell kinetics, and establish the impact of such heterogeneity on cell's functional
        responsiveness; and (ii) to extend this focus to memory T cell subsets to
        identify the rules governing birth and death within each. To achieve these
        goals we will use a combination of mathematical modeling and dedicated experiments
        in mice, connecting our results to mechanisms of T cell homeostasis in humans
        wherever possible. Achieving the aims of this proposal will be a long stride

        internist and an investigator in the HSR&D Center for Organization, Leadership,
        and Management Research (COLMR) at VA Boston Healthcare System. This proposal

        to the fields of patient safety and quality of care, especially as thy pertain
        to appropriate medication use.  The first proposed research objective will
        center on elucidating Veterans' and clinicians' perspectives on intentional
        medication discontinuation, a part of the prescribing process that to date
        has not been explored. Building on qualitative work in progress, Dr. Linsky
        will develop two survey instruments: one to elicit patients' attitudes and

        an independent research career focused on multilevel factors associated with
        oral health using a strengths-based approach to reduce pediatric oral health
        disparities. The oral health of a child cannot be separated from family, community
        and the environment; thus it is vital to include a multilevel perspective
        in any comprehensive model of children's oral health. My research in the K99
        phase will describe the maternal psychosocial and behavioral factors associated
        with ECC and also will describe the prevalence of dental caries in a sample
        of Latino children. Measures taken from the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire
        (BRFQ) will be used to describe psychosocial and behavioral factors (e.g.,
        oral health locus of control, health beliefs, self- efficacy, Sense o Coherence,
        stress, importance of oral health, oral health knowledge and behaviors) in
        Latina mothers of preschool children in Denver, Colorado. The results of this
        study will be compared to that of a high-risk American Indian population in
        which similar measures from the BRFQ were used. During the R00 phase, a mixed
        methods approach will be used to describe the differences at child, family
        and community levels for caries-free and caries-active urban dwelling Latino
        children. This methodology will capture the factors measured by the BRFQ survey
        and then will use qualitative methods to further probe characteristics at
        each level. I will use asset mapping, which is one on the strengths-based
        approaches, to describe the protective health assets that enhance the ability
        of individuals, families, communities and social systems to maintain and sustain

        SUMMARY\\nThe availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly reduced

        SUMMARY\\nOver the past two decades, there has been substantial growth in
        opioid consumption during pregnancy,\\ndiagnoses of opioid use disorder among
        pregnant women, and neonatal complications from in utero opioid\\nexposure.
        Untreated opioid use disorder among pregnant women leads to poor outcomes
        for the mother and\\ninfant; however, opioid agonist treatment (OAT) for opioid
        use disorder is highly effective. OAT improves\\ntreatment retention, reduces
        relapse risk, reduces HIV-risk, reduces criminal behavior, reduces risk of\\noverdose
        death, and improves birth weights. Further, ensuring access to OAT before
        pregnancy decreases the\\nlikelihood of illicit drug use during critical times
        of fetal development in the first trimester. Despite evidence that\\ntreatment
        is effective in mitigating adverse outcomes from opioid use disorder, evidence
        suggests that the vast\\nmajority of patients in need of treatment do not
        receive it. We will conduct a rigorous and reproducible field\\nexperiment
        of randomly-selected outpatient buprenorphine providers and opioid treatment
        programs in 10\\nstates with a range of state policies. The study will include
        simulated female patients of reproductive age with\\nrandomly-selected characteristics,
        including pregnancy status. We aim to determine whether: 1a) pregnant\\nwomen
        with opioid use disorder are more likely to experience difficulty accessing
        OAT when compared with\\nnon-pregnant women, 1b) insurance type modifies ability
        to access OAT, and 2) state policies promote or\\nhinder access to treatment.
        The proposed study uses a rich array of methodologies and leverages an\\nexperienced
        research team with expertise in qualitative research, health law, addiction
        medicine, biostatistics,\\nhealth policy, health services research, and economics.

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children under 2 are a high risk
        group for severe morbidity and mortality after respiratory infections, including
        influenza. In addition to lacking years of immunological experience and memory
        responses, neonatal and infant immune systems have other qualitative and quantitative
        distinctions from adults. In this proposal, we will\\nexamine a special role
        for γδ T cells in providing protection in the very young. These cells possess
        features of both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity. γδ T cells have
        not been extensively studied during influenza infection, and the mechanisms
        by which these cells protect the respiratory mucosa are not known. Published
        reports suggest a relatively limited role in promoting inflammation; however,
        these studies were done in adult animals. Our preliminary data indicate that
        γδ T cells play a necessary role in the survival of neonates after influenza
        infection, perhaps due to the immaturity of other immune effectors. This protection
        depends on γδ T cell-induced IL-33 production. IL-33 regulates ILC2 activity
        and eosinophil recruitment, bot of which play roles in restoring epithelial
        integrity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is tat γδ T cells initiate
        an immune cascade that promotes survival in neonatal influenza infection via
        the recruitment and activation of ILC2s and eosinophils. Our three aims test
        the specific hypotheses that 1) γδ T cell promote survival after influenza
        infection in neonatal mice by secreting IL-17, which leads to the induction
        of IL-33 from lung epithelial cells, 2) that IL-33 downstream of γδ T cell
        activation leads to ILC2 activation and eosinophil accumulation, which are
        necessary for recovery of lung function in neonates, and 3) that a similar
        regulatory network is operating in humans, which we will test using a valuable
        repository of clinical human isolates. These experiments will define a distinct
        protective mechanism operating in the very young, establishing a role for
        γδ T cells and IL-17 production upstream of a Type II immune profile that\\nprovides

        Project Summary\\nThis is a proposal for a fourth renewal of travel grant
        R13AA017107. For the last nine years, this grant has\\nprovided funding to
        support scientific dissemination and early career investigator (ECI) career
        development at\\nthe annual convention of the American Psychological Association
        (APA). Psychologists make up a major\\nconstituency in the scientific community
        of alcohol researchers and on topics related to alcohol. The APA is\\nthe
        largest organization of psychologists and their trainees in the US, and its
        annual convention attracts\\nthousands of attendees. In particular, APA Division
        50 (Society for Addiction Psychology) and Division 28\\n(Psychopharmacology
        and Substance Abuse) are heavily populated with alcohol researchers, with
        further\\nalcohol researchers in Divisions 38 (Health Psychology) and 5 (Quantitative
        and Qualitative Methods), many of\\nwhom are recipients of NIAAA funding.
        This R13 grant represents a collaboration between Division 50\\n(primary)
        and Divisions 28, 38, and 5 (partnering divisions) to achieve two goals: (1)
        to disseminate the state-\\nof-the-art alcohol research to the psychological
        community; (2) to foster the development of the next\\ngeneration of alcohol
        researchers from the psychological community. The first goal will be achieved
        by\\nsupporting state-of-the-art alcohol research within the Division 50,
        28, 38 and 5 conference programs. This will\\ntake the form of travel support
        for speakers in two symposia that showcase advances and innovations in\\nalcohol
        research. In addition, these symposia and other alcohol research will be communicated
        to conference\\nattendees via an \\\"Alcohol Research Highlights\\\" brochure.
        The second goal will be achieved by providing 20\\ntravel awards to ECIs (i.e.,
        graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty) and hosting an
        ECI\\nposter session/social hour. In addition, the R13 will support a career
        development symposium each year. For\\nboth, the dissemination goal and the
        career development goal, the R13 will reach out to women and\\nunderrepresented
        minorities to maximize inclusion. To date, this R13 grant has been highly
        successful in\\ndisseminating advances in alcohol research and nurturing the
        careers of early career alcohol researchers. The\\ngoal for the next segment
        is to sustain these contributions to the field.\",\"project_title\":\"Enhancing

        ABSTRACT\\nPsychosocial Wellbeing of Refugee Children after Release from Family
        Immigration Detention\\nIn the spring and summer of 2014, the US experienced
        the largest single surge of mothers with minor children\\nmigrating through
        Mexico to the US from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. About 68,000 mothers
        and\\nchildren were apprehended at the US border. Despite increased immigration
        enforcement, families kept\\ncoming: 39,838 in FY15, 77,674 in FY16, and 75,622
        in FY17. The US created family detention centers, two of\\nthem in South Texas,
        to hold these families and tens of thousands of mothers and children have
        been held for\\nperiods ranging from a few weeks to years. There is virtually
        no data on what toll immigration detention is\\ntaking on the children and
        we have little empirical knowledge of how they are faring after release. While\\nresearch
        on refugee children from Africa and the Middle East held in detention in Australia,
        Britain, and\\nCanada shows negative physical and psychological effects, we
        do not know what the post-detention\\ndevelopmental, physical, and socioemotional
        status is for Central American children who were held in US\\nfacilities and
        who now reside temporarily or permanently in the US. As a first response to
        this gap in our\\nknowledge, we seek to develop methods for studying the psychosocial
        wellbeing of children who were held\\nwith their mothers in detention centers
        for weeks and months during critical childhood development. Our\\noverarching
        objective is to understand the conditions of these children after release
        and inform research and\\ntreatment efforts. This project has two exploratory/developmental
        aims: To (1) devise recruitment procedures,\\ntest instruments, and develop
        qualitative interviews for studying Central American children previously held
        in\\nUS immigration detention and now residing in local communities; and (2)
        examine children’s detention\\nexperiences and post-release psychosocial wellbeing.
        We will interview 84 children in middle childhood (ages\\n6 to 12) who were
        held previously in immigration detention with their mothers for a period of
        at least two\\nweeks. Mothers and children will provide post-detention information
        on family functioning; children’s physical,\\npsychological, and behavioral

        (provided by applicant): Obesity has emerged as one of the most critical health
        care problems in the US as 69% of the US population is currently overweight
        or obese. Adipose tissue dysfunction is an essential hallmark linking obesity
        to the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disease, and prior work form our group
        has demonstrated that qualitative properties of adipose tissue shape systemic
        phenotypes. In particular, impaired adipose tissue angiogenesis in obesity
        has been associated with inflammation and metabolic dysfunction; however pathogenic
        mechanisms are incompletely understood. We describe a novel endogenous isoform
        of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), VEGF-A165b that is selectively
        over-expressed in obesity and inhibits angiogenesis. Our preliminary data
        suggest that perturbations in the Wnt5a signaling system up-regulates VEGF-A165b
        under conditions of obesity that is modified by bariatric surgical weight
        loss. In aim 1, we will examine adipose depot-specific microvascular angiogenic
        responses in biopsied fat samples from 150 obese and 50 lean subjects. We
        will characterize VEGF-A isoforms in relation to angiogenic capacity and vascularization.
        We hypothesize that inhibitory isoform VEGF-A165b will be up- regulated in
        obesity, associated with anti-angiogenic actions in fat, and relate to whole
        body metabolic dysfunction. In aim 2, specific inhibitors of Wnt signaling
        will be employed using human adipose tissue samples secured from aim 1 to
        provide a molecular framework for understanding the regulation of VEGF-A 165b
        expression. In aim 3, we will re-examine adipose angiogenic capacity and VEGF
        isoform expression at 6 months following bariatric surgery in the same 150
        obese subjects from aim 1. We will test whether relevant molecular pathways
        specifically identified in aim 2 are influenced by weight reduction. We seek
        to identify novel determinants of adipose tissue biology and angiogenesis
        in relation to metabolic changes which will develop in association with marked
        weight loss in obese individuals. Our proposal may identify the Wnt5a-VEGF-A
        165b axis as a novel modulator of angiogenesis, adipose tissue biology, and
        consequently, systemic disease in clinical obesity and potentially lead to
        the identification of new therapeutic targets.\",\"project_title\":\"Anti-Angiogenic

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of HIV is ~60% higher
        in women than men in sub-Saharan Africa, and this gender inequity is a key
        challenge to HIV control. Identifying women at greatest risk for HIV and their
        infecting male partners is critical for effective, targeted control of the
        African HIV epidemic. It is also vital to identify those HIV-infected women
        most likely to contribute to ongoing viral spread. However, African women
        vastly underreport sexual contacts and high risk occupations such as sex work
        in interview-based surveys and clinical settings making their identification
        challenging. Here, we propose to use phylogenetic, epidemiological, and qualitative
        methods to study network drivers of female risk of HIV acquisition and onward
        transmission to men in the rural Rakai District, Uganda. We will use existing
        data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), a population- based study
        of HIV incidence and behaviors in 50 communities (n~17,000). In Aim 1 we will
        identify HIV- infected women who have central roles in transmission networks
        using viral phylogenetics and then characterize them with RCCS epidemiological
        data. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with these women to gain deeper
        insight into their HIV-related risks and to understand the barriers to reporting
        these risks. In Aim 2 we will use viral phylogenetics in conjunction with
        probabilistic statistical models to identify the pool of infecting male partners
        tat sustain the excess HIV burden among Rakai women. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will
        use microsimulation models to estimate the potential effectiveness of various
        combination HIV prevention strategies targeted to high risk subgroups to reduce
        HIV incidence. The proposed research is part of a K01 award and will provide
        the applicant with the advanced training in HIV modelling, behavioral science,
        and phylogenetics necessary to transition to an independent investigator with
        expertise in the application of interdisciplinary methods to HIV epidemiology
        and prevention. Results will improve female HIV risk assessment and identify
        candidate targeted strategies to prevent HIV in African women. It also will
        provide critical formative data fr a future R01 to implement and empirically
        assess the effectiveness of targeted interventions to high risk women and
        their partners in Rakai.\",\"project_title\":\"Revealing women's hidden role

        hotspots. MixMD has superior\\nperformance over other cosolvent MD methods
        like MacKerell’s SILCS and Barril’s MDmix. Other methods are\\nplagued by
        many spurious, misleading, “extra” sites that indistinguishable from real
        binding sites, which greatly\\nhinders prospective applications.\\nOur long-term
        goal is to improve SBDD by developing methods that more accurately model protein-ligand\\nbinding.
        Our underlying hypotheses are 1) MixMD’s more complete description of the
        physics of binding yields\\nbetter hotspot predictions than traditional SBDD
        methods and 2) both qualitative and quantitative data from\\nMixMD can be
        used in SBDD.\\nThis proposal outlines two areas for developing MixMD and
        increasing its impact on SBDD. Specific Aim 1\\ndevelops methods for calculating
        the free energies, entropies, and enthalpies of the hotspot probes.\\nComparisons
        will be made between occupancy-based, energy-based, and kinetics-based methods
        for\\ncalculating those key binding properties. Specific Aim 2 will address
        a series of key challenges in SBDD. First,\\nMixMD will be used to identify
        bridging water molecules in binding sites. Clearly, hotspot locations ascertain\\ndisplaceable
        water, but it is just as important to pinpoint required, bridging waters in
        binding sites. Second, the\\naccessibility of difficult, cryptic sites will
        be examined. While mapping the sites, we will determine whether\\npocket opening
        and probe binding are sequential events where probes “capture” open states
        or concerted\\nevents where probes “induce” open states by pushing against
        the malleable torsions of the cryptic pocket.\\nLastly, MixMD data will be
        used to predict druggabilities of binding sites. The Non-Redundant set of
        Druggable\\nand Less Druggable binding sites (NRDLD) will be used to derive
        a druggability index based on number of\\nhotspots, their affinities, their
        proximities, and their degree of burial in the protein.\",\"project_title\":\"Mapping

        Summary\\nClinical management of obstructive lung diseases such as asthma
        and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\n(COPD) relies heavily of drugs
        that are either agonist or antagonists of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).\\nThis
        is because GPCRs control important airway cell functions (contraction, growth,
        cytokine/chemokine\\nproduction, chemotaxis, and permeability) that become
        dysregulated in disease. Unfortunately, these drugs\\nhave limitations with
        respect to both efficacy and safety, and many patients experience suboptimal
        control. We\\npropose to identify new, more effective ligands that target
        the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3\\nmAChR) as a potential COPD
        therapy, by embracing the emerging concept of biased agonism pharmacology.\\nBiased
        agonism pharmacology is based on the discovery that GPCRs can assume multiple
        conformations that\\ntransduce qualitatively different signals, and ligands
        can “tune” GPCRs to bias signaling to one pathway or\\nanother. We propose
        to discern qualitative signaling properties of the M3 mAChR and determine
        how\\ncanonical (G protein-dependent) versus non-canonical (arrestin-dependent)
        signaling regulates airway smooth\\nmuscle (ASM) functions that are often
        dysregulated in COPD. We have discovered both small molecule\\northosteric
        ligands as well as a peptide that can bias M3 mAChR signaling toward the arrestin
        signaling\\npathway. Preliminary data also strongly suggest arrestin-dependent
        signaling mediates therapeutically\\nbeneficial ASM functions. Lead agents
        in hand as well as those that emerge in focused screens will be tested\\nin
        cell- and tissue-based studies of ASM signaling and function, and ultimately
        in an in vivo model of COPD to\\ndiscern the utility of these drugs as COPD
        therapeutics. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will employ genetic\\nand molecular
        strategies, including use of mice with arrestin subtype genes ablated, to
        establish the regulatory\\neffects of arrestins on M3 mAChR-mediated functions
        (contraction, growth, and synthetic functions) in airway\\nsmooth muscle.
        Aim 2 will employ semi-high throughput screening systems, ASM signaling and
        functional\\nassays, and novel engineered M3 receptors to fully characterize
        those biased agents in hand and to discover\\nadditional biased ligands and
        peptides. Aim 3 will test our lead biased M3 ligands in an in vivo model of
        COPD\\nto verify the ability of a biased pharmacology approach to manage the
        disease. The impact of the proposed\\nstudies lies in their ability to significantly
        advance the science underlying, and ultimate clinical application of,\\nbiased

        SUMMARY\\n The objective of this NIDA K08 career development proposal is to
        gain experience and training to\\nbecome an independent investigator focused
        on the development of evidence-based practices to prevent and\\ntreat substance
        use disorders in the emergency department. Opioid use disorders, including
        overdose and\\naddiction, have become epidemic in the United States. While
        research has largely focused on long-term opioid\\nprescribing in the outpatient
        setting, emergency department opioid prescribing for acute painful conditions
        as a\\nportal for future adverse patient outcomes remains poorly defined.\\n
        State governments, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, have reacted
        to the opioid crisis in\\npart by crafting legislation to broadly limit legal
        opioid prescriptions. However, opioid medications remain an\\nimportant treatment
        option for some acute painful conditions, and evidence based guidance on appropriate\\nprescribing
        is lacking, in part because the factors that impact providers opioid prescribing
        behaviors and\\nsubsequent patient associated adverse outcomes remains unknown.
        Understanding the underlying\\nfactors that influence opioid prescribing behaviors
        and future patient outcomes, including state legislation, peer\\nbehaviors,
        hospital attitudes, and local culture, is a critical step in developing integrated,
        evidence-based\\nrecommendations that focus on transforming the culture surrounding
        safe opioid prescribing practices.\\n Using the theory of planned behavior
        as a framework, the goals of this K08 grant application are to\\nunderstand
        opioid prescribing behaviors and adverse patient outcomes through the following
        aims: First, we\\nwill assess the influence of state legislation, specifically
        the 2016 Massachusetts (MA) Opioid Law, on the\\nformation of hospital-based
        regulations and providers' perceived attitudes towards opioid prescribing
        through\\nqualitative interviews with local physician leaders in MA. Second,
        using comprehensive claims data, we will\\nevaluate the impact of the 2016
        MA Opioid Law on statewide opioid prescribing, using a neighboring state\\nwithout
        opioid legislation as a natural control. Finally, we will examine the association
        of an initial opioid\\nprescription on clinically relevant patient outcomes
        in order to better understand how restricting opioid\\nprescriptions through
        legislation may impact emergency department patients presenting with an acute
        painful\\ncondition.\\n From our results, we will create evidence-based recommendations
        to enhance existing opioid\\nlegislation, as well as develop and execute R01
        funded comprehensive implementation trials that focus not\\nonly on changing
        behaviors of individual providers, but also transforming the group culture
        and social norms\\nthat influence opioid prescribing behaviors.\\n!\",\"project_title\":\"SPOiLER:

        (provided by applicant): Macrophages are myeloid lineage cells that reside
        in virtually all tissues of the body and play essential roles in immunity,
        tissue homeostasis and wound repair. Responses to bacterial and viral infection
        are associated with a 'classical' program of macrophage activation involving
        NFκB and other signal-dependent transcription factors that direct expression
        of genes that promote inflammation and initiate innate and adaptive immune
        responses. Low-grade forms of classical macrophage activation are causally
        linked to the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory diseases that include
        type 2 diabetes. Conversely, resident macrophages in healthy adipose tissue
        exhibit features of an 'alternative' program of macrophage activation, involving
        the IL4/ STAT6/PPARγ axis. The STAT6/PPARγ-dependent transcriptional program
        is linked to expression of genes that actively maintain tissue homeostasis
        and insulin sensitivity. Although the pathways responsible for classical and
        alternative activation are highly conserved, individual variation in the functional
        responses of these pathways is proposed to influence risk for diseases in
        which inflammation plays a pathogenic role. In this application, we propose
        to build on recent conceptual and technical advances and the vast natural
        genetic variation provided by inbred strains of mice to comprehensively decode
        the transcriptional circuitry underlying classical and alternative macrophage
        activation. These studies will test and extend a general collaborative/hierarchical
        model for the selection and function of signal-dependent enhancers required
        for the transcriptional outputs of NFκB and PPARγ through three Specific Aims.
        Specific Aim 1 will leverage the >50 million SNPs provided by 5 inbred strains
        of mice to identify the collaborating transcription factors required for the
        genome-wide binding patterns of NFκB and PPARγ in classically or alternatively
        activated macrophages, respectively. Specific Aim 2 will extend these studies
        to define the requirements for the transition from transcription factor binding
        to enhancer\\nactivation. This aim is based on the hypothesis that an essential
        feature of a functional enhancer is that it is actively transcribed. Specific
        Aim 3 will use a novel form of network modeling informed by effects of natural
        genetic variation and chromatin connectivity maps to functionally link specific
        enhancers to target genes. General predictions regarding the modularity of
        NFκB and PPARγ-activated enhancers will be tested in human macrophages. If
        successful, these studies will result in qualitative advances in our understanding
        of classical and\\nalternative macrophage activation, enable insights into
        effects of natural genetic variation on these responses and disease, and provide

        in care  among HIV+ BAAW. To accomplish these aims, we propose a mixed methods
        social network study with 100 at-risk, self-reported HIV-negative BAAW in
        San Diego, California and up to 500 of their social network contacts (total
        N=600). In Phase I we will use surveys and egocentric network interviews to
        assess individual and network characteristics reported by BAAW and their networks.
        In Phase II we will conduct focus groups to assess the acceptability of a
        social network-based intervention involving influential network members. The
        proposed research will advance the President's National HIV/AIDS Strategy
        to \\\"reduce new infections, increase access to care, and reduce HIV-related

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application for
        a K23 award for a fellowship trained pediatrician specializing in Pediatric
        Nutrition and childhood obesity. The candidate is committed to an academic
        career as a physician scientist conducting patient-oriented research in childhood
        obesity. This award will support the candidate's training and attainment of
        expertise in three areas: qualitative research methods, cultural tailoring
        of technology-based interventions, and implementation science. This training
        will support his overall goals of designing and rigorously testing childhood
        obesity interventions that can be readily translated and disseminated and
        that will provide critical insight for care in diverse settings and patient
        groups. To achieve these goals, Dr. Haemer has assembled a cross-disciplinary
        mentoring team, each with outstanding experience in research methods and strong
        records of successful mentoring: Dr. Glasgow, a behavioral scientist who is
        renown within the field of implementation science; Dr. Bull, an expert researcher
        in technology-based health promotion; and Dr. Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition
        specialist with extensive research and clinical experience in childhood obesity
        and with a long history of mentoring young investigators. The proposed research
        addresses the huge knowledge gap in cost-effective ways for the healthcare
        system to influence both patient-level and population-level outcomes for childhood
        obesity. Evidence-based approaches of surveillance, screening, prevention
        and treatment largely remain uncertain or untested, especially for the youngest
        children from groups at highest risk of obesity-related health disparity.
        This K23 award will study methods for prevention and treatment applied to
        Latino preschool-aged children from low- income families. The research will
        test the central hypothesis that culturally tailored screening and counseling
        will be more effective at decreasing BMI trajectory than usual care. Specific
        aims include: 1. To characterize components of primary care interactions that
        should be culturally tailored to enhance motivation for healthy lifestyle
        change among Latino parents with preschoolers 2. To design a technology-user
        interface that maximizes acceptance by Latino parents of young children. 3.
        To pilot test a technology-supported screening and counseling protocol tailored
        to Latino parents using findings of Aims 1 and 2. Using an implementation
        science perspective, we will assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation
        fidelity, and sustainable maintenance of the intervention in clinical practice
        during the pilot RCT. This research and training will form the basis for an
        RO1 proposal to test technology-supported childhood obesity prevention and
        treatment interventions targeting young children from low-income Latino families.

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \\n   \\nStability in intimate
        relationships is of central concern to veterans and is crucial for their mentl
        health, recovery from illness, overall functioning, and quality of life. The
        VA is increasingly prioritizing support for intimate relationships through
        the promotion of recovery-based approaches that include partners and families.
        PTSD has a destructive effect on veteran's intimate relationships, leading
        to higher rates of relationship distress, problems with sexual function and
        intimacy, abuse, separation and divorce, and this is true for younger, as
        well as older, veterans. PTSD symptoms such as avoidance and numb disconnection,
        intrusive images and memories, and anger and irritability are incompatible
        with feelings of closeness and sexual intimacy. Sexuality is central to intimate
        relationships, self-esteem, and quality of life, yet thee are few studies
        of sexual dysfunction among veterans with PTSD, and none have been identified
        that take a biologically informed approach. Notably, the neuroendocrine processes
        activated in PTSD and sexual behavior are similar. The biological parallels
        between sexual arousal and activity and PTSD symptomatology may provide one
        basis for understanding problems with sexual intimacy and attachment. Sexual
        arousal mimics the physiological experience of fear, and once these associations
        have been forged it can be difficult to uncouple them. This grant builds upon
        a large literature on the neurochemistry and neuroendocrinology of PTSD and
        proposes the first in depth characterization of the problem of sexual dysfunction
        in veterans with PTSD. The proposed study employs a mixed-method, cross-sectional
        design to investigate biological and psychological correlates of sexual dysfunction
        in male OEF/OIF/OND combat veterans. Specifically, this investigation will
        assess distinct components of sexual dysfunction (e.g., lack of desire, problems
        with performance and consummation) and their associations with PTSD symptoms
        and severity and with endocrine markers, including catecholamines (epinephrine,
        norepinephrine, dopamine) and glucocorticoid sensitivity, that are implicated
        in PTSD. One hundred male OEF/OIF/OND veterans with PTSD who are currently
        in an intimate relationship will be studied. This study will also use qualitative
        interview data from 0 veterans to better characterize sexual dysfunction in
        PTSD. This investigation represents the first step in characterizing the psychobiology
        of sexual dysfunction in PTSD, and is highly clinically relevant for veterans.
        Understanding the psychological and biological underpinnings of PTSD related
        problems with intimacy and sex may help distinguish between avoidance of intimacy
        and inability to perform sexually, thereby directing treatment choice, contributing
        to the\\nidentification of clinically significant subtypes, and ultimately
        informing efforts to develop psychological and pharmacological interventions
        for sexual and relationship problems in PTSD. The information generated from
        this study will provide the necessary foundation for the development of a
        new intervention targeting sexual dysfunction in PTSD, to be pursued in a
        MERIT proposal by the end of the CDA period. Such an intervention has the
        potential to strengthen relationships and promote recovery from PTSD.\",\"project_title\":\"Biological

        Tobacco smoking is causally related to at least 12 cancers types. Although
        the strongest causal links\\nhave been found for lung and head and neck (H&N)
        cancers, other cancers have a moderate causal link.\\nCancer diagnosis often
        motivates patients to quit smoking, but more than one third continue to smoke.
        The\\nmajority of smoking cessation studies have focused on patients with
        the cancers most directly associated with\\nsmoking: lung and H&N. This is
        logical, given that smoking prevalence is highest among these cancer patients,\\nand
        research (including our preliminary study) indicates that they are the most
        motivated and most likely to quit\\nsmoking. However, across cancer types,
        continued smoking after diagnosis carries multiple risks with respect\\nto
        cancer treatment efficacy, treatment complications, development of second
        primary tumors, and cancer\\nrecurrence. Thus, regardless of cancer type,
        smoking cessation is critically important for cancer patients.\\nTherefore,
        there is an urgent need to extend smoking cessation motivation and behavior
        change interventions\\nto include patients with cancers across the cancer
        spectrum, particularly those with cancers that the public\\ndoes not readily

        intervention to increase cessation motivation\\nfor recently diagnosed patients
        with a cancer not widely known to be associated with smoking (i.e., those
        with\\nmoderate or unknown smoking-related etiology). We will conduct two
        rigorous studies, initially focusing on\\nbreast, colorectal, gynecological,
        skin melanoma, and bladder cancer types. In Study I, based on the\\nTeachable
        Moment Model, we will create separate targeted self-help interventions in
        the form of\\nbooklets/pamphlets for each of these five cancer types. We will
        follow a three-phase process: (1) qualitative\\nassessment to collect data
        on smoking cessation and cessation motivation among representative cancer\\npatients;
        (2) development of the content of the intervention based on Phase 1 results;
        (3) testing the initial draft\\nof the intervention with the target population
        and modifying based on feedback. After the intervention is\\ndeveloped, Study
        II will assess its feasibility and acceptability by distributing the new booklets/pamphlets
        to\\ncancer patients who are current smokers and have been diagnosed with
        one of the five cancer types (N=50).\\nIn addition to feasibility and acceptability,
        we will collect indices of changes in cessation motivation and\\nbehavior.
        These data will provide valuable information for a subsequent, fully-powered

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 application is designed
        to prepare the applicant for a successful, independently-funded research career
        applying methods of stakeholder engagement to investigate the epidemiology
        of trauma, specifically psychiatric disturbances following TBI. Psychiatric
        disturbances such as depression, anxiety, and post- traumatic stress disorder
        (PTSD) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are associated with poorer cognitive
        and functional recovery and efficacious treatment would likely improve outcomes.
        The long term goal of the proposed research is to advance the conduct of patient-centered
        outcomes research on treatment for psychiatric disturbances following TBI
        to improve the quality of care. The primary objective of this application
        is to prioritize patient-selected strategies to overcome barriers to receipt
        of treatment for psychiatric disturbances following TBI.\\nThe specific aims
        are: 1) Assess patient-centered barriers and facilitators of treatments across
        comparator treatments and patient groups; 2) Evaluate current treatment patterns
        and comparative safety associated with treatment of psychiatric disturbances
        following TBI; and 3) Prioritize patient-selected strategies to overcome barriers
        to the receipt of treatment for specifi comparator treatments and populations.
        Two approaches will be employed to identify barriers and facilitators of the
        receipt of treatment for the three most common psychiatric disturbances following
        TBI (depression, anxiety, and PTSD). I will implement training in methods
        of patient engagement and work with my PCOR advisory committee and mentors
        to identify and recruit patient partners, including individuals with TBI,
        their family members, and healthcare providers. We will use focus groups and
        interviews to assess patient-centered barriers and facilitators of treatments
        across comparator treatments and patient groups and identify comparator treatments
        for psychiatric disturbances for comparative safety analyses. Next, I will
        quantify disparities in treatment patterns associated with the three most
        common psychiatric disturbances following TBI and perform comparative safety
        analyses to identify variation of treatment risk among defined subgroups.
        Finally, I will work with my PCOR advisory committee to prioritize patient-selected
        strategies to overcome barriers to the receipt of treatment for psychiatric
        disturbances following TBI. The proposed research employs the best of qualitative
        and quantitative approaches to assess the treatment of psychiatric disturbances
        following TBI. Patients with TBI will form part of a research advisory committee
        that will be actively engaged throughout the research process and will drive
        research questions. The significance of this research is that it will improve
        the quality of care for patients with psychiatric disturbances following TBI
        by prioritizing patient-selected strategies to overcome barriers to the receipt
        of treatment, and providing needed information on treatment patterns and safety
        of current pharmacologic treatments.\",\"project_title\":\"Prioritizing Quality

        health centers randomized to the intervention condition will be trained in
        the adapted CVD prevention\\ncurriculum. The community health workers will
        then enroll 20 participants with diabetes at each site into the\\n12-week
        intervention. Psychosocial (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs) and behavioral
        (e.g., smoking,\\nhealthy eating) risk factors for cardiovascular disease
        will be assessed via self-administered surveys during the\\nfirst of the 12
        weekly educational sessions. Clinical risk factors (i.e., BMI, blood pressure,
        lipids, blood sugar)\\nwill be abstracted from existing patient records at
        the health centers. We will then assess changes that occur at\\nthree months
        (immediately after the 12-week intervention) and 12 months. Changes in the
        intervention clinic\\nwill be compared to changes over the same time period

        Summary:\\nFailure to deliver care near the end of life that reflects the
        needs, values and preferences of patients with\\nadvanced cancer remains a
        key shortcoming of our cancer care delivery system. National organizations\\nincluding
        the National Academy of Medicine and American Society of Clinical Oncology
        have called for\\nincreased attention to advance care planning (ACP) to improve
        patient-centered care near end of life. A critical\\nbarrier to progress in
        the field is a lack of evidence about the most effective and efficient ACP
        strategy to\\nimprove treatment decisions near end of life and ensure patients'
        wishes are honored.\\nTwo different patient-facing ACP interventions are widely
        used and known to be effective but entail sizeable\\ndifferences in costs
        and complexity to deploy: (1) in-person discussions with trained facilitators
        and (2) web-\\nbased advance care planning using interactive videos. These
        approaches have never been compared directly; it\\nis therefore unclear whether
        one form of ACP is more potent—and if so, for whom and under what\\ncircumstances.
        Understanding the relative effectiveness of in-person, facilitated versus
        web-based ACP is\\nimportant because in-person ACP requires far more resources.\\nThis
        proposal is a single-blind, patient-level randomized trial to address this
        evidence gap, using mixed\\nmethods to compare the effectiveness of in-person,
        facilitated ACP vs web-based ACP among 400 patients with\\nadvanced cancer
        and their family caregivers. Aim 1 compares the effect of these approaches
        on patient and\\nfamily caregiver outcomes (engagement in ACP—primary outcome;
        ACP discussions with family caregivers and\\nphysicians; advance directive
        (AD) completion; and caregiver symptoms of depression and anxiety). For\\npatients
        who die during the study period, we will use validated, caregiver-reported
        measures to compare\\nperceived quality of EOL care, patients' EOL goal attainment,
        and bereaved caregiver symptoms of depression,\\nanxiety and post-traumatic
        stress. Aim 2 assesses implementation costs of each intervention and effects
        on\\nhealthcare utilization at end of life. Aim 3 identifies contexts and
        mechanisms influencing the effectiveness of\\neach approach.\\nThis trial
        will have a high impact because it will provide new and much-needed empirical
        evidence about two\\npatient-facing ACP approaches that successfully overcome
        limitations of traditional written advance directives\\nbut entail very different
        investments of time and resources. It is innovative in using mixed methods
        to\\nevaluate not only the comparative effectiveness of these approaches,
        but also for whom, how and in what\\ncircumstances they are effective. It
        is feasible because it builds on extensive infrastructure developed by an\\naccomplished

        smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, causing
        approximately\\n480,000 smoking-related deaths per year. The Food and Drug
        Administration (FDA) has the regulatory\\nauthority to enact tobacco product
        standards if such product changes would more likely than not have a\\npositive
        public health impact. In 2009, the FDA banned flavored cigarettes from being
        sold but allowed menthol\\ncigarettes to remain on the market. Nearly one-third
        of the cigarettes sold in the U.S. have menthol as a\\ncharacterizing flavor,
        and these cigarettes are associated with low quit rates in vulnerable populations.
        Survey\\ndata suggest that large proportions of menthol cigarette smokers
        would quit if menthol cigarettes were no\\nlonger available. Therefore, tobacco
        control policies aimed at limiting access to menthol cigarettes may have\\nmajor
        public health benefits. However, if menthol cigarettes were no longer available,
        smokers may switch to\\nflavored little cigars or cigarillos (LCCs) due to
        their similarities to cigarettes. From a harm reduction\\nperspective, switching
        to LCCs rather than quitting smoking or using non-combustible tobacco products
        will not\\nimprove individual or population-level health outcomes. Thus, tobacco
        control policies focusing on menthol\\ncigarettes may need to apply broadly
        to all combustible tobacco products. Behavioral economics is an ideal\\nframework
        for addressing this research question because it applies economic constructs
        such as response\\ncost, product substitution, and demand elasticity to understand
        product consumption and decision-making. We\\nare proposing a within-subjects
        laboratory study and followed by validation field assessments to understand\\nhow
        restricting access to menthol cigarettes would affect alternative tobacco

        four lab sessions and two field assessments. During two of the\\nlab sessions,

        menthol cigarettes would affect the purchase\\nof alternative products, which
        will include menthol LCCs in one session but not include menthol LCCs available\\nin
        another session. After these lab sessions, participants will be provided with
        the tobacco products they\\npurchased to use during a 3-day field assessment

        with these participants will be conducted to learn more about their experiences

        SUMMARY\\nIschemic stroke affects 700,000 individuals annually in the U.S.
        and is the leading cause of long-term disability\\nin adults. Current acute
        stroke treatment paradigms (i.e., reperfusion therapies) are not widely applicable
        to\\nmost patients due to a very narrow therapeutic window. New approaches
        that can be offered acutely to the\\nmajority of ischemic stroke patients,
        and continued throughout the duration of post-stroke care, can limit stroke\\nseverity,
        can complement or even enhance rehabilitation, and could transform ischemic
        stroke recovery. The\\ntreatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among patients
        with acute ischemic stroke represents one such\\nnovel therapeutic approach.
        The Recovery In Stroke Using PAP (RISE-UP) study is a randomized controlled\\ntrial
        among 180 patients with acute ischemic stroke and moderate/severe OSA diagnosed
        by ambulatory\\npolysomnography comparing PAP treatment with usual care over
        6 months. The randomization scheme will be\\n1:1:1 (n=60 acute intervention:
        n=60 subacute intervention: n=60 control/usual care). Acute intervention patients\\nwill
        start PAP within 1-week post stroke symptom onset, and subacute patients will
        start PAP 1-month post\\nsymptom onset. Both groups will continue PAP therapy
        through the duration of the study, reinforced with\\ntechnical assistance
        and behavioral support. All patients will receive a healthy lifestyle education
        intervention\\nfocused on secondary stroke prevention. The primary outcome
        is functional stroke recovery at 6 months as\\nmeasured by the Modified Rankin
        Scale (mRS). Secondary outcomes measures include stroke severity\\n(NIHSS),
        the Berg Balance Scale, falls, actigraphic measures of motor activity, symptom
        measures of\\nsleepiness (ESS), vitality (SF-36), depression (PHQ-9), cognition
        (MoCA), and quality of life measures (SSQOL,\\nSAQLI). The Specific Aims:
        (1) Test whether a PAP treatment for OSA in ischemic stroke improves stroke\\nseverity,
        post-stroke physical activity, post-stroke symptoms, and stroke functional
        recovery (primary outcome).\\n(2) Determine whether acute vs subacute initiation
        of PAP in ischemic stroke results in greater improvement in\\npost-stroke
        outcomes (stroke severity, physical activity, symptoms, stroke recovery).
        (3) Conduct qualitative, in\\ndepth, interviews with 25-30 stroke patients,
        the family members, and acute care providers to elicit their\\nexperience
        with PAP use, including factors that influence adherence. Exploratory Aim:
        Evaluate whether\\npolysomnographic measures have prognostic utility in understanding
        the variability in stroke recovery. This work\\nwill be accomplished by an
        experienced multidisciplinary team of investigators (sleep medicine, nursing,\\nneurology,
        respiratory therapy, physiatry, and behavioral science) and will fulfill a
        critical step towards\\ndeveloping new clinical practice pathways that involve

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to drug disposition,
        children (especially neonates and infants) are different than the adults.
        Therefore it is not appropriate to select dosing regimen for this special
        population based on empirical scaling (e.g., based on body weight) of the
        adult dose. This issue becomes more significant as it is not always possible
        to establish safety and efficacy of drugs in the children at clinic due to
        logistical, ethical, safetyand medico- legal concerns. For instance, out of
        399 prescribed drugs to neonates/infants between 1997-2010, only 28 drugs
        were studied for the safety and/or efficacy. Thus, it is imperative that novel
        alternative approaches are developed to predict safe and efficacious dosing
        regimens for children. One such approach is to integrate age- dependent physiological
        parameters with drug specific parameters (e.g., in vitro enzyme/transport
        kinetic data) to develop a pediatric physiologically based pharmacokinetic
        (pPBPK) model. Once validated, such fully mechanistic pPBPK model can be generalized
        for any drug. However, the biggest hurdle in developing such models for children
        are the lack of absolute ontogeny data on the proteins that are related to
        drug disposition, i.e,, drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and transporters.
        It is known that developmental pattern exists in the expression of major hepatic
        DMEs, but the available data are either qualitative/semi-quantitative or completely
        missing for most of the DMEs/transporters. Therefore, as a first step towards
        rectifying this gap in knowledge we propose to quantify the hepatic expression
        of DMEs and transporters in our unique pediatric livers (n=220) and compare
        this expression with that in adults. We will use selective and robust multiple
        reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomic approach to quantify these proteins. Once
        the age-dependent protein abundance data are available, these data can be
        integrated with in vitro kinetics and other developmental (physiological)
        information to construct a pPBPK models. Such rationally designed models can
        be validated using available clinical data on the model compounds, and then
        generalized to drugs that are eliminated by these mechanisms in the liver.
        Because mechanistic pPBPK models can delineate fractional role of individual
        metabolic/transport pathways in drug disposition, such mechanistic tools are
        also capable of accurately predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and pharmacogenetic
        variability mediated by these pathways. Hence, this proposal addresses the
        mechanisms of hepatic drug disposition in neonates to adolescents. The pPBPK
        model generated in this study will be of enormous value with respect to child
        health as these will be important to assess the risk associated with the first
        use of drug (or other xenobiotics) in children (including neonates/infants,
        where the ontogeny matters most).\",\"project_title\":\"PBPK prediction of

        SUMMARY\\nPrimary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary
        angle closure disease (PACD), is a\\nleading cause of permanent blindness
        worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment\\nmethod,
        is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability
        to quantify disease severity,\\nespecially in patients with early angle closure.
        Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a\\nquantitative
        and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there
        are limited methods\\nfor clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle
        closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career\\ndevelopment
        proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment
        OCT-based approach\\nto evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification
        models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements;\\nand 2) to provide an academic
        glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience\\nnecessary
        to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will
        provide critical skills and\\nexperiences necessary to establish an independent
        research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to\\nimprove the clinical
        care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional
        training in\\nfour vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic
        disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction\\nof disease risk; 3)
        biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated
        data analysis.\\nThe proposed research will use population-based data collected
        as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American\\nEye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT
        and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength\\nof
        association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship
        between the degree\\nof angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular
        pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong\\nrisk factor for glaucoma,
        will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using
        a novel\\npupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski
        Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification\\nmodels for PACD stage and severity
        based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine\\nlearning
        algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD.
        The results of the\\nproposed research will provide the foundation for a future
        longitudinal study examining the benefit of using\\nanterior segment OCT-based
        assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver\\ntargeted
        treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research

        Summary/Abstract\\nBert-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is caused by germline mutations
        in the folliculin (FLCN) gene. Cystic lung\\ndisease with pneumothorax is
        a major clinical manifestation of BHD, with cysts reported as early as 34
        weeks’\\ngestation and pneumothorax as early as age 14. The mechanisms underlying
        cystic lung disease in BHD are\\npoorly understood, representing a critical
        knowledge gap. We deleted Flcn specifically in mouse lung\\nmesenchyme, and
        discovered striking phenotypes of early postnatal alveolar enlargement and
        adult pulmonary\\ncysts that resemble the lung pathology in BHD patients.
        FLCN localizes to the lysosome, where it is a key\\nactivator of mTORC1, suggesting
        that abnormal mTORC1 signaling is a potential mechanism for Flcn’s impact\\nin
        the lung. We have also discovered that Tcf21, a mesenchymal transcription
        factor, is a novel candidate of\\nFlcn physical interacting protein, and that
        Tcf21 is downregulated in Flcn-deficient cells and tissues. Therefore,\\nwe
        hypothesize that mesenchymal inactivation of Flcn leads to age-dependent defects
        in alveolar development\\nand homeostasis via two parallel effectors: mTORC1
        and Tcf21. This hypothesis will be tested in two Aims.\\nAim 1: To determine
        how loss of Flcn in lung mesenchyme impacts alveolar development and homeostasis
        in\\nvivo. We will test the working hypothesis that mesenchymal Flcn is required
        for alveolar growth and\\nmaintenance in an age-dependent manner. Our approaches
        will include temporal-spatial Flcn deletion in lung\\nmesenchymal cells. The
        BHD-like lung lesions in mice will be characterized at pathologic, cellular,
        and\\nmolecular levels, including quantitative and qualitative analyses of
        lung mesenchymal progenitor cells.\\nAim 2: To determine the mechanisms through
        which Flcn-deficiency in lung mesenchymal cells leads to\\ndefective alveolar
        development and homeostasis, in vitro and in vivo. (A) To determine how Flcn
        regulates\\nmesenchymal mTORC1 activity and how mTORC1 impacts alveolar development
        and maintenance. We will\\ntest the working hypotheses that Flcn-deficient
        lung mesenchymal cells have dysregulation of mTORC1 activity\\nand that downregulation
        of mTORC1 activity in lung mesenchyme will phenocopy the alveolar defects
        in our\\nmice with Flcn inactivation in lung mesenchyme. (B) To determine
        how the Flcn-TCF21 interaction impacts\\nalveolar growth and maintenance.
        We will test the working hypotheses that Flcn directly interacts with Tcf21
        to\\nregulate Tcf21-dependent targets in lung mesenchyme, and that the absence

        Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award for Dr. Stephanie
        Mueller, a medical hospitalist and researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital
        (BWH) in Boston, Massachusetts. The broad goal of the work in this application
        is to improve the safety and quality of care transitions of hospitalized patients.
        More specifically, the objectives of this proposal are to identify which patients
        benefit and do not benefit from transfer between acute care hospitals (inter-hospital
        transfer, IHT) as well as define the associated risks of IHT, and use this
        knowledge to develop an intervention to promote safer hospital transfers.
        This work will be carried out in three phases.\\nFirst, CMS data will be used
        to determine the association of IHT with several outcomes, including cost,
        length of stay, and mortality among different populations of patients with
        common diagnoses. These analyses will employ advanced epidemiologic methods
        to control for confounding and examine interaction of patient and hospital
        characteristics with IHT on patient outcomes, including Cox regression analysis,
        propensity score analysis, and regression analyses with effect modification.
        The second phase will focus solely on transferred patients to allow for an
        in-depth analysis of transfer process factors and patient outcomes. In this
        phase, we will first employ qualitative methodology to conduct and analyze
        interviews of a cohort of transferred patients and caregivers, to gather a
        more detailed understanding of reasons for transfer, expectations of care,
        and satisfaction with the transfer process. Then, we will utilize local hospital
        data to quantitatively examine a cohort of transferred patients identifying
        specific of the transfer process (i.e., time of day of patient arrival) and
        patient characteristics that are\\nassociated with increased cost, length
        of stay and mortality. In the third phase of this work, we will use the information
        gained from the first two phases and existing knowledge about safe transfer
        practices to develop a standardized IHT process, and conduct a pilot study
        using interrupted time series methods to examine the impact of this intervention
        on the quality of patient transfer. This information will then be used to
        inform development of a multi-center, cluster randomized controlled trial
        as a future R01 submission. Throughout the award period, coursework, strong
        mentorship, input from a multi-disciplinary Advisory Committee, and institutional
        support will advance the candidate's methodological skills in epidemiologic
        analysis and hospital-based outcomes research. She will also further develop
        her ability to translate research findings into interventions that will successfully
        impact the clinical care of hospitalize patients. Taken together, this multi-faceted
        proposal will facilitate Dr. Mueller's development int an independent investigator
        in hospital- based quality improvement and patient safety research.\",\"project_title\":\"The

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heroin use is associated with significant
        medical and social problems. In addition to HIV and other blood-borne infections
        there is concern about mounting heroin-related overdose (HOD) and bacterial
        skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus
        aureus (MRSA) infections. Social concerns include trafficking-related violence
        and societal costs of heroin use eg incarceration and healthcare utilization.
        \ US heroin and illicit opioid supply and consumption are changing: in the
        past 20 years, as Colombian- sourced heroin gained dominance, heroin prices
        have decreased and purity increased to record levels; prescription opioid
        pill misuse has drawn in new populations that are younger, more rural, white
        and female. Nationwide heroin use is increasing dramatically due to robust
        availability of high quality heroin and a wave of dependent opioid pill users
        switching to this cheaper, more reliable supply. In addition the heroin supply
        is in flux wit evidence of sharply increased production in Mexico and a diversity
        of heroin products hitting US streets. What are the health and behavioral
        implications of use of these novel heroin source-forms?  Different source-forms
        of heroin are chemically distinct leading to different use patterns and medical
        consequences. Distribution of Colombian-sourced powder heroin (PH), a cold-water
        soluble heroin, is associated with greater HIV and HOD. New forms of powdered
        heroin are emerging regionally eg chocomil, gunpowder, fentanyl-laced heroin
        and cheese heroin; all are cold water soluble raising concerns about increased
        HIV and HOD risk. In addition, some market characteristics, eg branding, maybe
        associated with higher quality heroin and more negative consequences than
        others. How are changes in heroin supply, heroin market structure and quality
        affecting populations at risk and healthcare utilization and costs?  The Heroin
        in Transition study will investigate the rapidly evolving risk environment
        for heroin users in the US utilizing integrated micro- to macro-level anthropological,
        economic and epidemiological approaches. Specific Aim 1: To assess, through
        qualitative inquiry, the micro-personal risk behaviors of heroin IDUs related
        to their use of specific major and variant types of heroin in 2 sentinel and
        12 rapid assessment sites. Specific Aim 2: To examine the structure of heroin
        markets and retail heroin price/purity in 27 US MSAs, 1993-2014, relating
        them to changes in populations at risk, healthcare utilization and societal
        costs. Specific Aim 3: To develop longitudinal and agent-based models linking
        heroin and opioid market conditions, ie structure, availability and quality,

        SUMMARY\\nMortality in sickle cell disease (SCD) has shifted away from childhood
        and to young adulthood, with patients\\nfacing an increased risk of early
        mortality after leaving pediatric care. Lack of transition preparation and
        poor\\nsupport for the development of self-management skills play a significant
        role in the adverse transition\\noutcomes in this vulnerable population. It
        is therefore imperative to develop novel methods of self-management\\nsupport
        to prepare adolescents with SCD to manage their own health prior to leaving
        pediatric care. Problem\\nsolving, a key component of many chronic disease
        self-management programs, helps individuals overcome\\nbarriers to self-management.
        This makes problem solving an appealing intervention for adolescents with
        SCD\\nwho face myriad social challenges associated with race and poverty while
        being expected to learn how to\\nmanage a complicated chronic disease. This
        proposal describes a four year integrated research and education\\nplan to
        tailor and pilot-test an existing problem solving intervention developed by
        my primary mentors to\\nimprove self-management and transition readiness in
        adolescents with SCD. My specific research aims are to:\\n1) conduct focus
        groups of adolescents with SCD and their parents to identify plausible intervention
        targets for\\nhow problem solving strategies could impact SCD self-management;
        2) tailor the generic problem solving\\nmodel to the specific function of
        improving self-management for adolescents with SCD based on the plausible\\nintervention
        targets identified in our first aim; and 3) conduct a single-arm adaptive
        pilot test of the tailored\\nintervention in order to optimize the content
        and delivery of the intervention through an iterative series of\\nquality
        improvement Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. My educational objectives are to gain
        additional training in 1)\\nhealth behavior change, including normal adolescent
        development, and problem solving as a cognitive-based\\nbehavior change strategy;
        2) intervention development, including the use of qualitative methods to enhance\\ncultural
        competency; and 3) clinical trial design, including rigorous pilot methodologies
        and the design and\\nconduct of definitive trials. The results of this award
        will prepare me for my long term career goal as an\\nindependent investigator
        focused on developing and evaluating interventions to improve transition for\\nadolescents
        with SCD. The research in this application builds directly on my prior work
        which has focused on\\nmeasuring transition readiness and developing quality
        metrics for transition in SCD. I have put together an\\nexperienced mentoring
        team within a supportive research environment to help me gain the expertise\\nnecessary
        to be successful in this work and in my long term career goals. The results
        of this project will lead\\ndirectly to a subsequent grant to conduct a multi-site
        RCT of our tailored intervention and will help establish my\\ncareer as an
        independent investigator and expert in transition in SCD.\\n \",\"project_title\":\"Development

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracheal intubation (TI) is a commonly
        performed life-saving procedure for critically ill children, but associated
        with frequent complications and adverse safety outcomes. With prior AHRQ and
        Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigator (PALISI) network support,
        we conducted a robust risk assessment using our multi-center pediatric TI
        safety registry: National Emergency Airway Registry for Children (NEAR4KIDS).
        We implemented a first generation TI quality improvement QI bundle including:
        1) a TI risk factor checklist, 2) a bedside \\\"time-out\\\" immediately before
        TI, 3) a bedside \\\"time-out\\\" immediately after TI to debrief, and 4)
        quantitative debriefing among participating centers to\\nshare best practices.
        The evaluation of the clinical impact of this QI bundled intervention is ongoing
        with promising preliminary results (adverse TI associated event rate dropped
        from 19% to 16% across all NEAR4KIDS sites). However, with this QI implementation
        process, we have identified two precursor events: hypoxemia and multiple TI
        attempts, which need to be addressed to further improve TI safety.  In this
        project, we will implement two easily adoptable interventions: apneic oxygenation
        (administration of oxygen throughout TI procedure via nasal cannula) and primary
        use of video laryngoscopes to reduce adverse TI associated events by minimizing
        hypoxemia and multiple attempts. This project will rigorously evaluate the
        clinical impact of this second generation QI intervention across a diverse
        spectrum of (large and small, academic and private) pediatric ICUs. Further,
        this project will identify and mitigate new QI practice uptake, adoption,
        implementation processes and variances at the site level. This approach includes
        standardized outcome measures using our NEAR4KIDS registry, measures of new
        QI practice uptake, a novel cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis to track each
        site's performance prospectively, focus groups with sharp end multidisciplinary
        providers, and semi-structured interviews with site QI leaders. We will employ
        mixed- method quantitative and qualitative analyses to identify the key factors
        and barriers for this second generation bundled QI intervention adoption.
        Based on these analyses, we will further refine the QI implementation approach.
        The clinical impact of the implementation of apneic oxygenation and primary
        use of video laryngoscope will be measured prospectively by our NEAR4KIDS
        registry process of care measures, and most importantly by a meaningful absolute
        risk reduction in adverse TI associated events. Our NEAR4KIDS network has
        grown from 16 sites to 28 sites over last 2 years. At the completion of the
        this project, we have access to large implementation networks including PALISI
        and the American Heart Association life support training programs, who are
        poised to disseminate the findings beyond these 28 centers. Upon successful
        completion, we will understand the feasibility, barriers, and clinical impact
        of apneic oxygenation and video laryngoscopy on high-risk, but life-saving,
        TI procedural safety outcomes.\",\"project_title\":\"Improving the Safety

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common pediatric
        chronic disease, affecting more than 10% of American children (>7 million
        children <18 years)1 and disproportionately impacting urban, minority, and
        disadvantaged children.2 Despite the evidence-based guidelines for standardized
        care from the NIH,3 overall morbidity among youth with asthma, whether measured
        by attack rates, emergency department (ED) visits, or hospitalizations, has
        not significantly decreased in the last decade.4 Striking disparities persist\\namong
        youth with asthma, as socio- economically disadvantaged, urban, and minority
        children throughout the United States incur a disproportionate share of asthma-related
        morbidity.2,5 The overall ED visit rate for asthma, for example, among non-Hispanic
        African Americans (AAs) aged 0-17 years is 4.1 times greater than that among
        non-Hispanic whites, while the ED visit rate among Hispanics in the same age
        group is 1.8 times greater than non-Hispanic whites. Similarly, the asthma
        death rate among non-Hispanic AAs aged 0-17 years is 7.3 times greater than
        that among non-Hispanic whites, while the death rate among Hispanics in the
        same age group is 1.2 times greater than non-Hispanic whites.5 In a recent
        study to prioritize comparative effectiveness research in hospital pediatrics,
        asthma ranked as the #1 leading non-surgical diagnose for pediatric hospital
        admission, totaling costs of $570 million annually.6 Of striking importance
        for the health care system is that asthma is also in the top diagnoses for
        all-cause readmissions, with 80% of these asthma readmissions deemed potentially
        preventable readmissions.7 In this career training award, with a strong mentorship
        team, I propose a highly patient-centered approach to identifying and improving
        optimal outcomes for patients and families transitioning home after inpatient
        admissions for asthma exacerbations. Using the care coordination framework
        proposed by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in June 2014,8
        my mentors and I will utilize principles of patient-centered outcomes research
        (PCOR) and comparative effectiveness research (CER) to design and pilot a
        program of community health worker (CHW)-facilitated transition-to-home focusing
        on the changeover of care from inpatient to outpatient for patients hospitalized
        with asthma exacerbation. This project is highly significant (addressing a
        vulnerable transition for patients admitted with a common and costly pediatric
        chronic illness with high rate of preventable readmissions) and highly innovative
        (using a qualitative approach to identify stakeholders' perspectives to refine
        AHRQ's care coordination framework to improve the transition from hospital
        to home by utilizing CHW and pilot testing feasibility and acceptability,
        and patient-centered outcomes). Our overall aim is to develop and evaluate
        a patient-centered transition-to-home plan leveraging CHWs to target high
        risk pediatric patients requiring hospital admission for asthma exacerbations.
        Our hypothesis is that CHWs will improve patient-centered outcomes during
        the transition from inpatient to outpatient care.\",\"project_title\":\"Improving

        Summary:\\nYoung gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM)
        are disproportionately affected by HIV.\\nDespite this burden, most HIV prevention
        interventions target adult MSM (most of whom identify as gay) and\\nheterosexual
        youth, creating an urgent need for interventions for gay and bisexual adolescents.
        Further, self-\\nidentified bisexual men, especially adolescents, have been
        neglected in research. This is a critical problem\\nbecause: (1) there are
        as many, if not more, bisexual adolescent men than gay adolescent men; (2)
        bisexual\\nadolescent men engage in several HIV risk behaviors more than their
        gay peers; (3) bisexual adolescent men\\nare at increased risk for substance
        use–a robust risk factor for HIV; and (4) bisexual men face unique HIV\\nprevention
        issues. Given that bisexual men are rarely included in research and most existing
        research on them\\nfocuses on “behaviorally bisexual” adult men, little is
        known about factors that drive engagement in risk behavior\\namong self-identified
        bisexual adolescent men. Attending to bisexual identity is critical to reducing
        HIV and\\nsubstance use, because bisexuality is highly stigmatized and stigma-related
        stressors (e.g., concerns about\\ndisclosing one’s bisexual identity) impact
        sexual behavior, substance use, and healthcare utilization.\\nInterventions
        are also more effective when tailored to populations, underscoring the need
        for an intervention for\\nself-identified bisexual adolescent men. The goals
        of this study are to: (1) examine factors that drive engagement\\nin HIV risk
        behavior and substance use among self-identified bisexual adolescent men;
        and (2) develop and pilot\\ntest a tailored HIV and substance use prevention
        intervention for this population. In Phase 1, interviews will be\\nconducted
        with 60 diverse self-identified bisexual adolescent men ages 14-17 focused
        on sexual identity, sexual\\ndecision-making, substance use motivations, and
        intervention preferences/barriers. In Phase 2, a tailored\\nintervention will
        be developed using findings from Phase 1. In Phase 3, feasibility, acceptability,
        and preliminary\\nefficacy will be tested in a pilot randomized trial (N =
        60) with a waitlist control and one-month follow-up. This\\naward will provide
        the applicant with career development training in adolescent health, qualitative
        methods, and\\nintervention development at Northwestern University’s Institute
        for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and\\nWellbeing–a well-resourced, rich

        risk for HIV\\nand substance use, but little is known about factors that drive
        their engagement in risk behavior. By focusing on\\nself-identified bisexual

        SUMMARY\\n International Labor Organization (ILO) has recently drawn attention
        to migrant child laborers as an\\n underreported but highly vulnerable group.
        ILO has argued that migrant child laborers are even more\\n vulnerable compared
        to local child laborers due to harsher working conditions, less visibility,
        lack of parental\\n protection, and heightened disenfranchisement. Hence,
        a deeper understanding of the family circumstances\\n and processes in this
        context is critical in developing more effective interventions targeting this
        population.\\n According to ILO, 68 million children (ages 5 and 17) are child
        laborers, constituting about 11% of the child\\n population worldwide. Forty-one
        percent of these child laborers are female. Child labor has been associated\\n
        with serious health, developmental, educational, and psychological risks for
        youth.\\n Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) continues to be the continent with the
        highest incidence (21.7%) of child labor.\\nGhana is one of the SSA countries
        with the highest incidence of child labor (21.8%), 47% of which are females.
        In\\nGhana, adolescent girls frequently migrate alone from three highly impoverished
        northern regions to the southern\\ncities to work as laborers in the informal
        economy. Adolescent girls increasingly make up the majority of the\\nNorth-South
        migrants. Yet, there is a scarcity of research on the beliefs and attitudes
        of parents towards child\\nindependent migration and child labor. There is
        also limited understanding of the complex family processes\\nbehind the migration
        of adolescent girls to work as child laborers. These gaps are critical to
        address in order to\\nhave a more complete and contextualized understanding
        of girls' migration for work, which will subsequently\\ninform policies and
        programs for more effective interventions.\\n In light of the gaps in the
        literature, the purpose of this qualitative study is to explore parental ethnotheories\\n
        on childhood, child independent migration, and child labor, as well as family
        processes behind decision making\\n including multi-level factors (both protective
        and risk) that influence female children's/ adolescents' migration\\n from
        home to work as child laborers. The study will explore the perspectives of
        three groups of\\n parents/caregivers (n=90) from sending villages in two
        of the poorest districts of Northern region with adolescent\\n daughters:
        1. who migrated to work in the informal economy; 2. who dropped out of school
        but stayed in their\\n village; and 3.who remained in school full-time. Given
        the gap in knowledge on parental perspectives on female\\n child/adolescent
        migration for work in the cities, the findings of the proposed research study
        will contribute to\\n the literature on child/adolescent migration for child
        labor. The findings will also allow for more effective and\\n developmentally-,
        and contextually-relevant interventions.\\n The proposed study is relevant
        to global public health as it will provide insights into the push factors
        that\\n lead female children/adolescents to migrate alone to the city for
        child labor, which has critical negative\\n psychosocial and health outcomes.\",\"project_title\":\"Family

        Summary\\nGay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are at
        high risk for HIV-1 acquisition,\\nespecially in rights-constrained settings
        such as Kenya, where men's access to HIV prevention has been\\nimpeded by
        homophobia, stigma, and discrimination. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has
        the potential to\\ngreatly reduce HIV acquisition risk in this key population,
        if accessible, sustainable PrEP programming with\\ntailored, effective adherence
        support can be provided. To this end, close collaboration between PrEP program\\nimplementers
        and GBMSM-led community-based organizations is essential. In this R34 application,
        we\\npropose (1) to identify multi-level barriers and facilitators that influence
        GBMSM's ability to engage in the PrEP\\ncontinuum of care by examining socioecological
        factors that impact Kenyan GBMSM's lives, including sexual\\nand PrEP-related
        stigma, sexual health promotion, and resilience, through qualitative work
        with PrEP-\\nexperienced and PrEP-naïve GBMSM and peers engaged in HIV testing/counseling
        or PrEP programming; (2)\\nto adapt and enhance a theory-based and culturally
        relevant PrEP support intervention called Shikamana\\nPrEP that includes peer
        navigation and integrated “Next Step Counseling” to promote sexual health
        protection\\nstrategies, including PrEP uptake and adherence, among GBMSM
        in Kisumu, following steps 1-6 of the\\nADAPT-ITT model (assessment, decision-making,
        adaptation, production, expert review, and integration of\\nfeedback) in collaboration
        with our GBMSM community partners; and (3) to determine the acceptability,\\nfeasibility,
        and safety of the Shikamana PrEP intervention and estimate initial effect
        size compared to standard\\nof care on PrEP uptake and adherence assessed
        by drug levels over 6 months in a pilot randomized controlled\\ntrial. This
        proposal builds on the success of the Shikamana study, which developed a provider
        and peer\\nsupport intervention that successfully increased the odds of plasma
        viral load suppression among HIV-positive\\nGBMSM taking antiretroviral therapy,
        and the Anza Mapema project, which enrolled over 600 HIV-negative\\nGBMSM
        in Kisumu for 12 months of follow-up in HIV prevention services and is currently
        following a PrEP\\ncohort of 167 men for 12 months. Our experienced, productive
        multidisciplinary team of collaborators from the\\nUniversity of Washington,
        University of Michigan, and the Nyanza Reproductive Health Society, has expertise\\nin

        of 23 community-based LGBTI organizations in the study area. We anticipate
        that results\\nof the proposed research will have high impact by ensuring
        GBMSM involvement in the scale-up of effective\\nPrEP programming for this

        During the past 4\\nyears, 20 (of 124) VA facilities have successfully developed
        and implemented new home-based CR programs\\nmodeled on the AHA “Active Partnership
        for the Health of your Heart” manual. Between 2011 and 2015,\\nparticipation
        in CR among eligible patients more than doubled (from 10% to >25%) at VA facilities
        that\\ndeveloped home-based CR programs, but stayed flat (10%) at VA facilities
        that did not offer home-based CR.\\nHowever, there was marked variation in
        participation rates (ranging from 3% to 43%) across home-based CR\\nsites,
        and the reasons for these differences are unknown.\\n The proposed research
        will address three specific aims: (Aim 1) Determine the key factors of home-\\nbased
        CR programs associated with higher participation rates; (Aim 2) Identify barriers
        to adopting the best\\npractices identified in Aim 1, and develop a home-based
        CR program implementation plan that addresses\\nthose barriers; and (Aim 3)
        Conduct a pilot study to evaluate the effect of implementing this tailored
        home-\\nbased CR program (vs. usual care) on rates of CR participation and
        retention in patients with IHD. The\\nactivities performed under this award
        will prepare the candidate to conduct a multi-center, cluster randomized\\ncontrolled
        trial of implementing home-based programs to improve participation in CR.\",\"project_title\":\"Home-Based

        is estimated that between 1.3 and 2.1 million youth in the U.S. experience
        homelessness each year. While\\ncigarette smoking among youth in general continues
        to decline in the U.S., approximately 70% of unaccompanied\\nhomeless youth
        are current cigarette smokers. In addition to smoking cigarettes, 72% of these
        homeless youth\\nsmokers use alternative tobacco products (ATPs) such as e-cigarettes,
        cigarillos, hookah, and chewing tobacco or\\nother smokeless tobacco products
        – a rate which is substantially higher than national estimates for adolescents
        and\\nyoung adults. ATP use is associated with a range of health problems,
        and may be particularly problematic for\\nhomeless youth given the health
        threats they already face due to harsh living environments, poor nutrition,
        mental\\ndisorders, substance abuse, and inadequate access to health care
        and prevention services. Unfortunately, there\\nare no published studies of
        ATP use among homeless youth to guide efforts to prevent or reduce the use
        of these\\nproducts. This project will address a critical gap in the literature
        on youth tobacco use by focusing on ATP use\\namong homeless youth, as well
        as provide the type of comprehensive information on ATP use that is necessary
        to\\ninform programs aimed at preventing and reducing the use of these products.
        What is currently known about ATP-\\nrelated attitudes and behaviors among
        adolescents and young adults primarily comes from school-based samples,\\nand
        we cannot assume that existing findings generalize to “street youth” who are
        homeless and living on their own.\\nThe goals of this project will be achieved
        through three interrelated aims that utilize multiple data sources and mixed\\nmethods
        to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how to best reduce all forms of
        tobacco use among\\nhomeless youth. Aim 1 involves collecting qualitative
        focus groups data from homeless youth to better understand\\nof their: (a)
        knowledge of different types of ATPs; (b) experiences with and future intentions
        to use ATPs; (c)\\nmotivations to use ATPs and perceived pros/cons of specific
        ATPs; and (d) access to ATPs and exposure to ATP-\\nrelated advertising and
        marketing. Informed by the Aim 1 findings, Aim 2 involves collecting quantitative
        survey\\ndata from a probability sample of 300 homeless youth to: a) investigate
        the prevalence and patterns of ATP use; b)\\ncompare perceived availability,
        affordability, and harm between various ATPs and cigarettes; and c) identify
        the\\ncorrelates of current ATP use, intentions to use in the future, and
        quitting. Aim 3 involves developing\\nrecommendations for environmental policy
        and cessation treatment strategies, addressing both cigarette and ATP\\nuse
        among homeless youth, based on key findings from this project and a recent
        project by our team on cigarette\\nsmoking among homeless youth. We will obtain
        feedback on these recommendations, through interviews with\\nservice providers
        and focus groups with homeless youth, and disseminate a final report to key

        SUMMARY\\nRecent changes to the Medicare hospice benefit may adversely impact
        access to hospice care for terminal\\nAlzheimer’s disease and related dementia
        (ADRD) patients, who currently make up 16% of all hospice patients\\nand 36%
        of aged decedents. In 2014, the IMPACT Act introduced stringent hospice auditing
        procedures\\ntargeting long patient stays, and in 2016, Medicare implemented
        a two-tiered payment schedule reducing\\nhospice reimbursement after 60 days.
        Both changes aimed to dis-incentivize hospices from selecting for long-\\nstay
        patients, who were more profitable (and admitted at higher rates to for-profit
        agencies) than short-stay\\npatients. ADRD patients typically have longer
        length of stay (LOS) due to their lengthier and less predictable\\nend-of
        life (EOL) trajectories, and while circumstantial and qualitative evidence
        suggests that these changes\\nmay reduce ADRD patient hospice use, the effect
        of these policies is currently unknown. Hospice has been\\nrecognized as the
        best way to maintain the high quality of life (QOL) for severely-ill patients,
        and appears\\nparticularly beneficial to EOL ADRD patients given their complex
        needs. Therefore, decreased access to\\nhospice would adversely impact QOL
        for ADRD patients and their families. Thus, there is a critical need to\\nunderstand
        how these policies affect ADRD patients’ use of hospice. Our proposal directly
        addresses this\\nneed. We will determine the extent to which the implementation
        of the IMPACT Act (Aim 1) and the two-tiered\\npayment schedule (Aim 2) affect
        (a) hospice admission, (b) hospice LOS, and (c) the rate of live discharges
        for\\nADRD patients. Additionally, because for-profit hospice agencies may
        be more impacted by increased audits\\nand changes in monetary incentives,
        we propose to examine the extent to which policy effects on these\\noutcomes
        are different at for-profit versus non-profit agencies (Aim 3). To accomplish
        these aims, we will use\\neconometric methods to analyze Medicare hospice
        claims data from 2008 to 2018. This proposed research is\\na timely and necessary
        first step to investigate the policy effects on ADRD patient access to and
        use of\\nhospice. The findings of this research will (i) advance our understanding
        of how hospice providers respond to\\nregulatory oversight and monetary incentives,
        and will (ii) inform how policy levers can be used to improve the\\nMedicare
        hospice benefit in design, implementation, and oversight, in order to maximize
        the value and quality\\nof EOL care for the ADRD patient population. Our findings
        will also have a translational impact because other\\nMedicare beneficiaries
        with ‘non-traditional’ hospice diagnoses, who also have long and unpredictable
        EOL\\ntrajectories, may be similarly impacted. This proposal represents a
        first, necessary step in a planned research\\nagenda to improve EOL care for
        ADRD patients through use of policy and health systems changes.\",\"project_title\":\"Evaluating

        Summary/Abstract\\nThe overarching aim of the current application is to support
        the ability of the Mid-Atlantic Node to continue its\\nparticipation in and
        enhance the scientific research mission of the NIDA Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical
        Trials\\nNetwork (CTN) as the mission of the CTN continues to evolve. Our
        leadership of and participation in CTN\\nresearch has been substantial and
        forms the basis for continued contributions. In the most recent funding\\nperiod,
        we participated successfully in three CTN studies (0032, HIV Rapid Testing
        and Counseling; 0044,\\nWeb-Based Treatment of Substance Abusers; 0049, Hospital
        as the Opportunity for Patient Engagement),\\nconducted two ancillary studies
        and enrolled over 600 participants. Currently, we are participating in two\\nstudies
        (0051; 0059) and providing national leadership for CTN 0059, a study to develop
        and validate a\\nsubstance use screening and assessment tool for use in future
        CTN research. Our faculty offers expertise in a\\nwide range of research areas
        including behavioral and pharmacological treatment of substance abuse,\\ntreatment
        of adolescents with substance use disorders, medications development, contingency
        management,\\nscreening, assessment and brief intervention, HIV treatment,
        tobacco smoking treatment, clinical trials\\nmethodology and qualitative research.
        We propose to continue supporting our well-established Node\\ninfrastructure
        that is needed to carry out the CTN research mission and to continue contributing
        the expertise\\nand leadership available within the node. We envision and
        propose an innovative CTN research agenda with\\nhigh public health importance
        that will identify and intervene with substance users found within medical
        care\\nsettings. New research on Screening and Brief Intervention will seek
        to identify subgroups that may benefit\\nfrom this approach. Other proposed
        research will focus on linkage of patients with substance use at levels\\nrequiring
        more intensive intervention to treatment services. Patient Navigation will
        be examined as an\\napproach to facilitating the care transitions across service
        delivery systems and motivating patients to engage\\nin available services.
        This agenda builds on past CTN research and provides a visionary and feasible
        blueprint\\nfor cooperative multi-site research within the CTN and its affiliated
        medical care and drug treatment institutions.\\nWe have long maintained strong
        affiliations with an array of adult and adolescent community substance abuse\\ntreatment
        programs. Recent developments in health care have expanded the focus of our
        community\\ninvolvement increasingly toward medical settings, including those
        with comprehensive care models that deliver\\nboth primary care and behavioral
        health services. We will continue to affiliate and engage a variety of hospital,\\ncommunity
        health and substance abuse treatment agencies that will serve as future resources
        for recruitment\\nand conduct of CTN research. Overall, the Mid-Atlantic Node

        (provided by applicant): Smoking is a major cause of morbidity and mortality
        in the United States, leading to substantial health care costs and productivity
        losses each year. Current relapse prevention programs are associated with
        underutilization and poor response rates, necessitating new interventions
        that offer effective, accessible support for abstinence from smoking. The
        proposed research builds upon Dr. Magee's existing background by translating
        a well-established model of intrusive thoughts in anxiety disorders to better
        understand and intervene upon nicotine cravings during attempts to quit smoking.
        This model suggests that cravings are nearly universal during quit attempts,
        but are not closely linked to relapse. Instead, the way individuals think
        about their cravings predicts relapse. Aligning with recent recommendations
        in the literature, the proposed intervention will teach smokers to rethink
        and effectively manage responses to unpleasant cravings. This project will
        serve as the vehicle for Dr. Magee's long term career goal of building a research
        program focused on trials addressing novel mechanisms driving relapse in nicotine
        dependence. Achieving this goal will require new mentored experiences, as
        well as the requisite data for applying for an R01. As part of this award,
        Dr. Magee will receive needed training regarding 1) nicotine cravings and
        smoking cessation; 2) clinical research in community treatment settings, including
        primary care and substance use disorder community treatment programs; and
        3) advanced qualitative and methodological skills. Dr. Magee will also benefit
        from professional development activities including publishing, grant-writing,
        and specialized ethics training. The research plan consists of\\nthree phases
        leading to a pilot text messaging intervention to teach adults healthier styles
        of thinking about their nicotine cravings. Phases include 1) characterizing
        the ways smokers think about their nicotine cravings via a) semi-structured
        individual interviews with adult smokers (N=16-20), b) the development of
        the new Thinking Styles about Cravings Scale (N=150), and c) an ecological
        momentary assessment study testing how changes within individuals in thinking
        styles about nicotine cravings relate to and potentially account for changes
        in smoking behavior and distress (N=20); 2) adaptation of techniques from
        successful anxiety treatments to alter thinking about nicotine cravings; and
        3) pilot testing of a text messaging intervention to alter thinking about
        nicotine cravings and reduce the risk of relapse (N=40). Text messaging will
        be used to overcome known barriers to treatment access, making the intervention
        inexpensive, appealing, accessible at any time or location, and easily integrated
        into common community treatment settings. The primary mentor, Dr. Winhusen,
        and the mentorship team possess a range of expertise that is ideally matched
        to the training goals. Dr. Magee will acquire new skills\\nand knowledge that
        will facilitate his transition to an independent scientist conducting large
        community-based interventions for nicotine dependence.\",\"project_title\":\"Text

        Summary\\nMycobacteria produce two unusual polymethylated polysaccharides
        (PMPS), the 3-O-methylmannose\\npolysaccharides (MMP) and the 6-O-methylglucose
        lipopolysaccharides (MGLP). Both polysaccharides are\\nlocated in the cytoplasm
        where they have been postulated to regulate fatty acid and mycolic acid metabolism\\nas
        a consequence of their ability to form stable 1:1 complexes with long-chain
        fatty acids and acyl-coenzyme A\\nderivatives. These findings, however, have
        been derived from in vitro studies using purified polysaccharides\\nand fatty
        acids and it is at present unclear whether they accurately reflect the physiological
        relevance of PMPS\\nin intact mycobacterial cells.\\nStudies initiated by
        our laboratory have begun to shed light on the nature of the enzymes involved
        in MGLP\\nbiosynthesis and to yield the first recombinant strains defective
        in various aspects of MGLP biosynthesis.\\nPreliminary analyses of these strains
        point to an important role of MGLP in the adaptation of Mycobacterium\\ntuberculosis
        and Mycobacterium smegmatis to thermal stress. Consistent with this observation,
        earlier work by\\nDr. Ballou and associates revealed that a M. smegmatis strain
        partially deficient in PMPS production displayed\\naltered levels of unsaturated
        fatty acids. Taken together, these results are suggestive of the existence
        of a\\nrather unique mechanism used by mycobacteria to control fatty acid
        metabolism in response to stress.\\nWhether MGLP are essential for mycobacterial
        growth is currently unknown as none of the mutants generated\\nso far were
        totally defective in MGLP biosynthesis and their growth was only tested under
        a limited number of\\nlaboratory conditions. Likewise, the precise function
        of MGLP in the fatty metabolism of intact cells remains\\nessentially undefined
        since mutant characterization thus far has been restricted to the analysis
        of steady-state\\nlevels of fatty acids under conditions where MGLP may not
        be required for optimal growth, and has neither\\nthoroughly analyzed longer
        acyl chains such as mycolic acids, addressed de novo synthesis of fatty acids
        and\\nmycolic acids, or analyzed lipid contents.\\nWe propose under Aim 1
        to knock-out or knock-down in M. tuberculosis a number of MGLP biosynthetic
        genes\\nthat we identified so as to determine whether MGLP are required for
        growth under a variety of conditions\\nthought to mimic the physical environments
        encountered by M. tuberculosis during host infection. Under Aim\\n2, we will
        use these mutants as well as other recombinant strains presenting various
        quantitative or qualitative\\ndefects in MGLP synthesis that we will generate
        to shed light on the physiological function(s) of these\\npolysaccharides
        with a particular focus on fatty acid, mycolic acid and lipid metabolism.
        In addition to\\nadvancing our understanding of a novel and potentially critical
        physiological process of mycobacteria, our\\nproposed studies may prove useful
        in designing innovative and Mycobacterium-specific therapeutic strategies\\nfor

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nThe primary objective of this K23 research project is to
        prepare Jennifer K. Walter, MD, PhD, MS for her long-\\nterm goal of becoming
        an independent physician-investigator testing interventions in the field of
        cardiac\\ndisease and pediatric palliative care. Her immediate goal is to
        obtain the training, mentorship, and research\\nexperience necessary to successfully
        compete for R01 grants supporting intervention studies in this area. To\\nmeet
        this goal, Dr. Walter and her mentors have developed a comprehensive career
        development plan that\\nincludes: 1) advanced training in modification of
        clinician and team behavior, simulation-based team training,\\nrigorous quantitative
        and qualitative methods, and study trial design to evaluate bio-behavioral
        interventions; 2)\\nintensive mentorship from a team with whom Dr. Walter
        has a track record of collaboration and scholarship,\\nincluding Chris Feudtner,
        MD PhD MPH (primary mentor), Vinay Nadkarni, MD (secondary mentor), Martha\\nCurley
        PhD RN FAAN, and Robert Arnold, MD (advisory committee members); 3) protected
        research time in\\nan institution that has successfully supported numerous
        junior investigators; and 4) an innovative research plan\\nto develop and
        test an intervention with both CICU parents and teams that aims to optimize
        communication in\\nfamily meetings to better achieve patient, parent and team
        outcomes. Pediatric advanced heart disease is a\\nleading cause of non-accidental
        death for children. The children that die do so in the cardiac intensive care
        unit\\n(CICU), where many parents report being unprepared for the death and
        as a result, are unable to make goal-\\nconcordant decisions. Thus, there
        is a critical need to create evidence-based interventions that support\\nteams
        and families in effectively communicating about treatment goals. To achieve
        this objective, Dr.\\nWalter will identify a cohort of parents of patients
        with advanced heart disease and clinicians regularly\\nattending interprofessional
        team meetings in the CICU who will participate in family meetings. With this
        cohort,\\nDr. Walter will: 1) Use co-design methods working with parents of
        CICU patients and interprofessional team\\nmembers to custom adapt an intervention
        called CICU Teams and Loved Ones Communicating (CICU TALC)\\nto improve CICU
        family meetings; 2) Assess the acceptability and feasibility of CICU TALC
        on parent, patient,\\nand team outcomes with 20 clinicians and 46 parents
        of CICU children; and 3) Test the impact of CICU TALC\\non team and parent
        behavior in family meetings. The findings will provide evidence to justify
        a pragmatic step-\\nwedge methodological approach for a fully powered trial
        of CICU TALC. The research and career development\\nactivities outlined above
        will take place in the collaborative academic environment of the The Children's\\nHospital

        SUMMARY\\nFamily psychoeducation for adults with psychotic disorders in Tanzania\\nGlobal
        health officials have called for treatment of psychotic disorders to be prioritized
        in low- and middle-\\nincome countries where they have been severely neglected.
        A major obstacle to care for those living with\\npsychotic disorders such
        as schizophrenia globally is an absence of evidence-based practices appropriate
        for\\ncultural contexts where resources are scarce, families are fundamental
        for treatment, and where many affected\\nindividuals and their families hold
        traditional (i.e. non-biomedical) ideas about the cause of psychosis and seek\\ntreatment
        from traditional practitioners. Family psychoeducation (FPE) is an evidence-based
        practice used in\\nhigh-income countries to help individuals with psychotic
        disorders and their relatives to cope more effectively\\nwith the illness;
        however, FPE has never been tested in a low-resource country nor have the
        mechanisms of\\naction for this psychosocial intervention been fully identified
        in any context. This project posits that FPE has\\ngreat potential for improving
        the reach, quality, and effectiveness of mental health services for those
        with\\npsychotic disorders in Tanzania and other similar contexts worldwide—namely,
        by using family members as\\nco-facilitators for the intervention and by explicitly
        addressing the traditional beliefs and practices of affected\\nindividuals
        and their caregivers. The goal of this R34 proposal (RFA-MH-16-410) is to
        pilot test a tailored\\nFamily Psychoeducation model (FamPE) for adults with
        psychotic disorders and their relatives that is\\nappropriate for cultural
        settings inclusive of both traditional and biomedical ideas about mental illness
        and that\\nincorporates relatives as co-facilitators of the intervention.
        We will utilize formative research [70 qualitative\\ninterviews], an expert
        review panel, and a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) [72 patient/relative
        dyads] to\\nmeet these specific aims: 1) Assess how family psychoeducation
        can improve client outcomes, engage\\nfamilies and address gaps in mental
        health services in Tanzania from various stakeholder perspectives; 2)\\nDevelop
        the FamPE intervention for use in Tanzania by building upon and tailoring
        the SAMHSA Family\\nPsychoeducation Evidence-Based Practice Kit; 3) Elucidate
        the mechanisms of action and refine the mediation\\nand study outcome measures
        for the future R01; and 4) Pilot test the FamPE intervention to a) assess
        the\\nfeasibility and acceptability of an adapted FPE intervention for 12
        weeks, and b) explore its impact on patient\\nrelapse, quality of life and
        disability. This pilot effectiveness trial of FamPE will adequately prepare
        us for a\\nsubsequent R01 submission for a fully powered RCT of FamPE against
        the standard of care in Tanzania. This\\nproject supports NIMH's strategic
        priority of effectiveness research on therapeutic interventions with previously\\ndemonstrated
        efficacy for use with broader target populations and it also supports NIMH's
        priority for clinical\\ntrials to explicitly address whether the intervention
        engages the hypothesized mechanisms of action.\",\"project_title\":\"Family

        \  \\r\\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \\r\\nProject Background/Rationale:
        Tinnitus is common among Veterans, particularly those with a history of traumatic
        brain injury (TBI), and can result in substantial cognitive, emotional, or
        slep disorders. Over 1.1 million VA-enrolled Veterans were service-connected
        for tinnitus in 2013. Tinnitus is a life-long condition for which there is
        no \\\"cure.\\\" However, our team has developed Progressive Tinnitus Management
        (PTM), a program designed to be delivered in-person or by telephone to teach
        Veterans (with and without TBI) methods for managing tinnitus symptoms. In
        randomized, controlled trials, clinic-based and telephone- based PTM led to
        clinically-significant reductions in tinnitus-related distress and dysfunction.
        Therefore, translation of evidence-based PTM into routine clinical practice
        is an imperative next-step. We are conducting research to understand barriers
        to PTM uptake across VA sites. Preliminary findings have shown that: 1) sites
        with comprehensive TBI services may be more prepared to implement PTM; but
        that, 2) all sites lack data supporting the need for, and interest in, PTM
        among Veterans with tinnitus. Project Aims: This project will address this
        gap by examining the epidemiology of clinically-significant tinnitus among
        Veterans in the VA system of care. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) Identify
        the proportion of Veterans with tinnitus in need of clinical services; 2)
        Examine Veterans' interests in PTM, either clinic- or telephone-based; and
        3) Evaluate differences in Veterans' needs and interests by their TBI history.
        Project Methods: This two-year project will utilize a sequential mixed-methods
        study design. In Phase 1, we will conduct a survey of 1,200 randomly sampled
        Veterans identified with tinnitus and stratified by TBI history. Surveys will
        be mailed using a modified Dillman approach and will collect information on
        Veterans' tinnitus symptoms, severity, and dysfunction; interests in and perceptions
        of PTM; and overall health and functioning. In Phase 2, semi-structured telephone
        interviews will be conducted with a portion of survey respondents, purposively
        sampled based on response patterns to survey questions. Interviews will address
        Veterans' tinnitus symptoms and dysfunction; experiences with tinnitus-related
        healthcare; and interests in and perceived barriers to receiving PTM. Survey
        and interview data will be triangulated with VA administrative data to fully
        understand Veterans' needs for, and interests in, PTM services. Anticipated
        Impact: Tinnitus is an increasingly significant problem for Veterans, particularly
        those with a history of TBI. PTM is highly effective at reducing tinnitus-related
        dysfunction, but VA leaders and clinicians are in need of empirical data to
        support its implementation. Results of our research will directly address
        this need by generating contextualized (quantitative and qualitative) data
        on the number of Veterans in need of PTM services, their interests in receiving
        these services, and the personal experiences, attitudes, and beliefs that
        drive their expressed needs and interests.   \\r\\n   \\r\\n\",\"project_title\":\"Chronic

        Summary/Abstract\\n Our overall strategy for Hesperos is to utilize microphysiological
        systems in combination with functional\\nreadouts to establish platforms capable
        of analysis of chemicals and drug candidates for toxicity and efficacy\\nduring
        pre-clinical testing. This is a service based company that is developing low-cost
        in vitro systems\\ncontaining a novel “pumpless” microphysiological platform
        and serum-free medium formulation. The pumpless\\nintegrated system, using
        a rocking motion to pump the cellular medium, reduces the complexity and cost
        of the\\nfluidic circuit design and simplifies set-up and operation of the
        device. The system employs microelectrode\\narrays and cantilever systems
        that are integrated on chip to allow for noninvasive electronic and mechanical\\nreadouts.
        These functional readouts greatly reduce the number of biomarkers to be monitored
        for cell health\\nand function in our systems. We have constructed physiological
        systems that represent human cardiac,\\nskeletal muscle, neuronal, liver,
        vasculature, blood brain barrier, gastrointestinal tract and neuromuscular\\njunctions
        (NMJs). Various combinations of these organ modules can be integrated onto
        a single platform to\\nexamine interactions among organs due to interchange
        of drug metabolites or cell signaling molecules\\nproduced in response to
        drugs. Hesperos has worked with 7 firms using these multi-organ systems for\\npreclinical
        evaluation of drugs or toxicity tests on chemicals. Hesperos received a Phase
        II grant from NCATS\\nto apply advanced manufacturing technology to increase
        throughput and decrease the cost of the device.\\n We have made major advances
        in our Phase II grant to the point where Dr. Lili Porter (NCATS SBIR\\nAdministrator)
        and Dr. Dan Tagle (Program Manager of NCATS SBIR Program) have approved and\\nencouraged
        Hesperos to submit a Phase IIB application. To move this technology to a level
        where it can be\\ncost effective for routine applications in preclinical studies
        we propose a number of modifications to further\\nreduce manufacturing cost
        and improve performance and reliability. In an attempt to validate the system,
        we\\nwill partner with AstraZeneca, Roche Pharma Research (a heart/liver/hemodynamic
        model to test for cardiac\\nsafety) and Bioverativ (to validate a Myasthenia
        Gravis model using an NMJ system). We will determine if\\nthese systems can
        predict semi-qualitative multi-organ responses to those drugs and compare
        to human\\nclinical data where available. These studies will provide a basis
        for validation and qualification with the FDA.\\nAim 1 will make the use of
        the 4-organ system easier to incorporate into the workflow at pharmaceutical
        firms\\nand should reduce the cost of use to significantly less than animal
        studies and provide the advantage of\\nprediction of response in a human system.
        Aim 2 will utilize Hesperos’s systems to validate these 3 platforms\\nfor
        FDA qualification. While the systems still have significant value to pharmaceutical
        (or food or cosmetic\\ncompanies) without FDA approval, FDA approval would
        greatly accelerate adoption of this technology.\",\"project_title\":\"Automation

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nPediatric obesity affects 1 in 3 children in the US and
        represents a public health crisis [1]. In utero exposure to\\nmaternal obesity
        and caesarean section (C-section) are independently and jointly associated
        with offspring\\nobesity [2, 3]. Accumulating data suggests maternal obesity
        and C-section may seed an “obesogenic”\\nmicrobiome responsible for transmitting
        obesity risk from mother to child [4, 5]. Exclusive breastfeeding is\\nassociated
        with protection against pediatric obesity [6]; however, the association between
        human milk\\ncomponents and the microbiome that account for these observations
        are poorly characterized. Recent advances\\nin untargeted metabolomics provides
        a novel opportunity to comprehensively investigate how the human milk\\nmetabolome
        in combination with microbe-host interactions are associated with infant adiposity
        during the first\\nyear of life.\\nThe Principal Investigator, Dr. Dominick
        J. Lemas, Ph.D. will use high-resolution mass spectrometry as a tool to\\ninterrogate
        the human milk metabolome and infant microbiome in a longitudinal maternal-infant
        cohort of obese\\nand normal weight mothers that includes vaginally and cesarean
        section deliveries. The over-arching hypothesis\\nof this proposal is that
        the human milk metabolome will be associated with novel changes in the early
        infant\\nmicrobiome that alter risk for obesity and weight gain in the first
        year of life. In collaboration with a\\nmultidisciplinary team of expert mentors
        (including primary mentor Dr. Christian Jobin and co-mentors Drs. Josef\\nNeu,

        K01 career development proposal\\nis for Dr. Lemas to develop expertise in
        high-resolution metabolomics, biomedical informatics and longitudinal\\nclinical
        microbiome studies. The University of Florida (UF) boasts an intellectually
        rich research environment that\\nwill facilitate these goals. More specifically,
        longitudinal data collection will be completed at the NIH-funded UF\\nClinical
        and Translational Science Institute and human milk and stool metabolomics
        analysis will be completed\\nat the NIH-funded UF Southeast Center for Integrated
        Metabolomics (SECIM). Finally, microbial sequencing will\\nbe completed at
        the UF NextGeneration DNA Sequencing Core and high-throughput data analysis
        will be\\ncompleted at the UF Research Computing Center.\\nSpecific Aim 1
        will generate a data-driven recruitment plan using informant interviews and

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In South Africa, the country with
        the highest burden of HIV infection in the world, men either fail to access
        or drop out early from the 'cascade' of HIV testing, treatment and care at
        considerably higher rates than women. Linking men to care earlier, and keeping
        them retained and adherent for longer, will improve not only their own health,
        but will also directly translate into a range of better health outcomes for
        their partners,\\nfamilies and communities. There are many reasons men drop
        out of the HIV cascade but two critical factors are 1) the fragmentation within
        the health system across its various HIV-related services, and 2) a persistent
        gap between health system- and community-based efforts to support those living
        with-or trying to avoid-HIV infection. Few interventions exist, especially
        for\\nmen, to address these two critical gaps. This project-Using Information
        to Align Services and Link and Retain Men in the HIV Cascade-or 'i-ALARM',
        seeks to 'raise the alarm' about this under-recognized but urgent need, and
        to develop ways of using health information to more effectively coordinate
        the work of health system and community service providers. Its specific aims
        are 1) to understand the performance of the existing HIV cascade for men,
        and determine the factors affecting the scale and pace of men's movement through
        this cascade, 2) to develop a health information management (HIM) intervention
        that brings clinic and community-based providers together to improve the performance
        of this cascade, and 3) to pilot this intervention and evaluate in what ways
        it a) improves communication and coordination among clinic and community services,
        b) leads to changes in service design and delivery, and c) improves men's
        linkage to and retention in HIV care. To achieve Aim 1, we will conduct a
        mixed methods study of the local HIV cascade for men in a Cape Town health
        sub-district using qualitative formative research and a cohort study with
        retrospective and prospective cohorts. To achieve Aim 2, we will consult with
        health information and management experts to develop the HIM intervention
        and work with clinic and community providers already working together in a
        Cape Town community to establish a 'Men's Linkage and Retention in Care Task
        Team' (LRTT). In Aim 3, we will support the LRTT in piloting the HIM intervention
        and conduct an evaluation of this pilot, using both a mixed methods process
        evaluation of the pilot and an outcomes evaluation using the findings from
        the prospective cohort study begun in Aim 1. This project is innovative for
        not only using the HIV cascade as an overarching conceptual framework, but
        for operationalizing it concretely in an intervention that brings clinic and
        community stakeholders together to catalyze coordination of their efforts
        to link and retain men in care. We expect i-ALARM will produce a working model-up-scalable
        and transferable to other health problems and settings-for how health information
        management between clinic and community stakeholders can produce innovative
        and sustainable responses to critical public health needs.\",\"project_title\":\"Using

        New Method for Mosaic Analysis of Clonal Mutations in Mice\\nAbstract\\nThe
        advancement in genome technology has led to the discovery and accumulation
        of a large number of\\ndisease-associated genes. With the genetic information
        in hands, a bigger challenge and new opportunity now\\nis to determine which
        genes or gene combinations can serve as indicators of health and/or potential
        targets for\\ndisease prevention and treatment. Mouse models provide the primary
        means to functionally verify genetic\\nnetworks and causal links implicated
        from human genetic studies. With many recently developed technologies,\\nsuch
        as CRISPR-CAS, it is possible to produce mutant mouse strains carrying mutations
        in any defined locus\\nwith significantly reduced cost and increased speed.
        Under physiological conditions most disease-associated\\nmutations occur in
        single cells and expand clonally in somatic tissues of adult life. Studies
        suggested that\\nsomatic mutations and uneven clonal expansion contribute
        to many aging related human diseases, such as\\ncancer, stem cell failure,
        and decline of immune functions. Whether a mutation is a driver or simply
        a\\npassenger in clonal expansion and disease development is often inferred
        statistically or predicted by\\nassociation studies, and only occasionally
        backed up with genetic validations. It becomes even a bigger\\nchallenge to
        investigate how multiple somatic mutations work together to promote disease
        development.\\nCurrently, the field still lacks robust tools to evaluate the
        causal links between compound somatic mutations\\nand disease phenotypes.
        We have designed a new tool to induce and track clonal mutations in adult
        mice.\\nWhen combined with any conditional alleles, this method can be used
        as a common tool to produce lineage-\\nmarked clonal mutations. This system
        offers three attractive features: 1) The generation of mutant clones is\\nindependent
        of mitosis and thus can be performed in any adult tissues, including quiescent
        cells. 2) It\\nproduces independently marked wild type and mutant clones at
        the same time in the same animals. The wild\\ntype clones can be used as internal
        controls for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the mutant\\nphenotypes.
        3) It can generate any combination of mutations within the same lineage marked
        clone. Thus,\\ngenetic interactions between different mutations can be tested
        within the lineage marked clones. The\\nproposed study will further improve
        the design of this genetic tool to make it user friendly and with increased\\nclonal
        frequency for mosaic analysis in the hematopoietic system. This newly established
        tool will be applied\\nto clonal analysis of Id3 and Id2 mutations for their
        effects on the expansion, homeostatic maintenance, and\\ntransformation of
        hematopoietic cells. Both Id genes are important transcription regulators
        involved in\\nlymphocyte development and lymphomagenesis. Outcomes of the
        proposed study will be a mosaic analysis\\ntool with demonstrated utility
        in the study of immune cell homeostasis and tumorigenesis. The mosaic animal\\nmodels
        can serve as either discovery tools for understanding gene functions, or as
        vehicles for developing and\\ntesting preventive or therapeutic regiments.\",\"project_title\":\"A

        costimulation is a central tenet of T cell activation and tolerance, yet the
        mechanisms by which CD28\\nfunctions are still surprisingly poorly understood

        demonstrated that human Th17 differentiation is strongly\\ninhibited by CD28
        costimulation, while mouse Th17 cell differentiation is unaffected. These
        species differences\\nin CD28 responses create a problem in interpreting and
        studying the role of costimulation during Th17\\ndevelopment in vivo in our
        mouse models of autoimmunity. In a wider context of therapies that target
        T cells,\\nsuch as cancer immunotherapy, these inter-species differences in
        CD28 signaling create concern when\\nextrapolating mouse model findings to

        clinical trial which induced near-lethal cytokine storm in healthy Phase I

        signaling motifs in the relatively short CD28 cytoplasmic tail. It was recently

        amino acid, PYAP in mouse, PYPP in human,\\nand substituting A->P in mouse
        CD28 enhanced recruitment of signaling adaptors and downstream cytokine\\nproduction,
        recapitulating the response of human CD28 ligation. We therefore propose to
        generate a mouse\\nthat bears `humanized' CD28PYPP using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate
        a single point mutation in the proline\\ndomain. Importantly, the rest of
        the CD28 molecule will be murine, meaning that physiological levels of\\nexpression

        Th17 cells by demonstrating CD28-mediated suppression\\nof Th17 responses.

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is a leading
        cause of mortality in the United States and the foremost cause of cancer deaths.
        There are concerns that the decrease in cigarette smoking attained over the
        last several decades is now challenged by the increasing popularity of non-traditional
        tobacco products such as Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), commonly
        referred to as e-cigarettes. The effects of ENDS use on public health are
        not well understood, including its plausible effects on cigarette use initiation,
        re-uptake, and maintenance. Currently, ENDS face limited regulations in the
        U.S. ENDS marketing in particular is not regulated. However, the prevalence
        of ENDS use is rapidly increasing, especially among young adults (18-25 year
        olds) who appear to be the main target of ENDS marketing. Current studies
        on ENDS marketing have been mostly qualitative, focused on characterizing
        the contents of advertising or retail marketing. These studies suggest that
        ENDS are being promoted to attract youth/young adults and as safer alternatives
        to cigarettes. But there is little evidence available on the effects of ENDS
        marketing on young adults' beliefs and attitudes and how those beliefs and
        attitudes promote ENDS use, and by extension, cigarette use. Elucidating the
        mechanisms of how ENDS marketing operates to impact young adults' ENDS use
        and smoking behavior could provide specific directions to the development
        of regulations on ENDS marketing as well as ENDS/tobacco control media interventions.
        For example, policies and media interventions could be informed as to which
        aspects of ENDS marketing need to be controlled and countered. This research
        will employ longitudinal design and the dual- process theoretical framework
        to determine the roles of outcome expectancies and implicit attitudes in explaining
        the effects of ENDS marketing on ENDS and cigarette use progression among
        college students, including cigarette use initiation and re-uptake. Guided
        by our preliminary research, we specifically focus on 4 positive outcome expectancies:
        social enhancement (e.g., use to gain popularity), affect regulation (e.g.,
        use to regulate feelings), positive sensory experience (e.g., use to enjoy
        flavors), and positive health consequences. Consistent with the dual-process
        framework, which posits that spontaneous or automatic processes act parallel
        in decision-making to more conscious, reflective processes, we hypothesize
        that the effects of marketing on ENDS and cigarette use are mediated or explained
        by the 4 types of expectancies, jointly representing the reflective system,
        and by implicit attitudes, representing the spontaneous system. Spontaneous
        processes have never been assessed as mediators of the effects of tobacco
        product marketing on behavior in general and of ENDS marketing in particular.
        The multi-wave longitudinal design will facilitate rigorous causal inferences
        regarding the mechanisms of how ENDS marketing operates as well as help investigate
        marketing's role in young adults' changes in beliefs, attitudes and behavior
        over time. Thus, this research will employ powerful theoretical and methodological
        approaches and measures newly applied to ENDS research [e.g., Implicit Association
        Test (IAT)] to generate high quality information that currently does not exist.\",\"project_title\":\"Prospective

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bridging Income Generation with
        Group Integrated Care (BIGPIC) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading
        cause of mortality in the world. Diabetes, a major risk factor for CVD, is
        increasingly prevalent and responsible for substantial cardiovascular morbidity
        and mortality. Elevated blood pressure (BP) increases CVD risk among individuals
        with diabetes and pre-diabetes; BP control is therefore a powerful way to
        reduce CVD risk. Cost-effective, context-specific, and culturally appropriate
        interventions are critical, and both group medical visits and microfinance
        have the potential to achieve this. In partnership with the Government of
        Kenya, the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare Partnership has expanded
        its clinical scope of work in rural western Kenya to include diabetes and
        hypertension, and has piloted group care and microfinance initiatives with
        promising early results. However, the effectiveness of these strategies individually,
        and in combination, on improving CVD risk is not known. Thus, the overall
        objective of this proposal is to utilize a transdisciplinary implementation
        research approach to address the challenge of reducing CVD risk in low-resource
        settings. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that group medical
        visits integrated into microfinance groups will be effective and cost-effective
        in reducing CVD risk among individuals with diabetes and at increased risk
        for diabetes in western Kenya. We further hypothesize that changes in social
        network characteristics may mediate the impact of these interventions, and
        that baseline social network characteristics may moderate the impact. Aim
        1 is to identify contextual factors, facilitators, and barriers that may impact
        integration of group medical visits and microfinance groups in this setting,
        using novel qualitative research techniques. We will then design a contextually
        and culturally appropriate integrated group medical visit-microfinance model
        for CVD risk reduction. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of group medical
        visits and microfinance groups for CVD risk reduction among individuals with
        diabetes or at increased risk of diabetes, by conducting a four-arm cluster
        randomized trial comparing: 1) usual clinical care; 2) usual clinical care
        plus microfinance groups only; 3) group medical visits only; and 4) group
        medical visits integrated into microfinance groups. The primary outcome will
        be one-year change in systolic BP, and a key secondary outcome will be change
        in QRISK2 CVD risk score. We will also conduct mediation analysis and moderation
        analysis to evaluate the influence of social network characteristics on intervention
        outcomes. Aim 3 is to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of each
        intervention arm of the trial. The research will be accomplished by an Early
        Stage Principal Investigator with extensive experience in implementation research
        in low-resource settings, supported by a transdisciplinary team of investigators
        with diverse and complementary expertise. Our goal is to add to the existing
        knowledge base of innovative, scalable, and sustainable strategies to reduce
        CVD risk in diabetes and other chronic diseases in low-resource settings worldwide.\",\"project_title\":\"Bridging

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nThe overall goals of this proposed project are 1) to develop
        Dr. Mia Minen into a pain researcher in integrative\\nand complementary health
        with skills to conduct independent multidisciplinary research; and 2) to conduct
        a\\nclinical research study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
        a relaxation intervention for migraine\\npatients who present to the emergency
        department (ED). Dr. Minen will develop and advance her knowledge\\nbase,
        experience, and skills in 5 key areas through mentored training: 1) Mind-body
        intervention (MBI)\\ntechniques; 2) Advanced research methods (in health services,
        clinical trials, and mobile health strategies); 3)\\nEmergency medicine pain
        research methodology and responsible conduct; 4) New research design\\nframeworks;
        and 5) Prevention science, program intervention development, and comparative
        effectiveness\\nresearch. The long-term goal of the research training is to
        be able to independently develop, assess, refine,\\nand compare novel and
        existing evidence-based MBIs for migraine patients across medical specialties,
        with a\\nspecial focus on the emergency medicine and primary care settings.
        In addition, the purpose of the training is\\nto gain advanced skills to study
        the MBIs alone and in combination with nutraceuticals and medications. The\\nresearch
        proposed in this K23 application is important to understanding how evidence-based
        MBIs can be\\nmade more accessible for chronic pain patients in the acute
        care setting. It helps to set the framework for\\ntranslating evidence-based
        MBIs into use in other medical settings. Migraine, the chronic pain condition
        being\\nused as an example for study, is a significant public health issue.
        Migraine affects over 30 million Americans,\\nand it is considered to be one
        of the most disabling conditions. It is responsible for a substantial number
        of the\\nfive million headache visits/year to US EDs. The purpose of this
        research is to study use of progressive muscle\\nrelaxation, a MBI, in patients
        with migraine who present to the emergency department. During the study, we\\nwill
        use patient feedback to optimize the smartphone application (app) RELAXaHEAD,
        an app with PMR and a\\ndaily headache diary. We will then conduct a feasibility
        and acceptability study of the RELAX approach (use of\\nRELAXaHEAD and abortive
        migraine pain medication). The results of this research will inform a future
        R01\\napplication to conduct a large-scale trial of MBI for migraine patients
        who present to the ED. The proposed\\nresearch and training will be conducted
        at New York University Langone Medical Center's ED. Dr. Minen's\\nmentorship
        and advisory team includes an interdisciplinary team with experts in MBI and
        behavioral research,\\nmobile health, headache medicine, emergency medicine,
        qualitative and mixed methods research, population\\nhealth, and statistics.
        The proposed research and training plans will provide a strong foundation
        for Dr. Minen\\nas an independently funded clinical investigator dedicated
        to using MBIs alone and in combination with\\nnutraceuticals and medications

        ABSTRACT\\nThe overarching goal of this candidate's program of research is
        to improve behavioral and physical health and\\nreduce health disparities
        by using multimedia technology to deliver evidence-based interventions to\\nunderserved
        populations. The focus is sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition that disproportionately
        affects\\nthose of African descent. Many people living with SCD suffer from
        daily chronic pain as well as recurrent acute\\npain episodes that require
        medical attention. Opioid medication is the primary treatment for pain in
        SCD,\\ndespite its limited effectiveness and negative side-effects. The proposed
        K23 attempts to address the need for\\nan alternative, non-pharmacological
        pain treatment in SCD. Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT)\\nhas
        been found effective for reducing chronic pain and may be a low cost, easily
        accessible and scalable pain\\ntreatment in SCD. The candidate's K12 project
        tested a cCBT program for anxiety and depression; preliminary\\nresults suggest
        that patients liked using the program, but found that much of its content
        did not relate to their\\nlives. To address this limitation, the proposed
        K23 project will adapt an existing cCBT program for pain\\nmanagement to create
        ReThink Pain SCD, a culturally-tailored, mobile-phone delivered behavioral
        intervention\\ndesigned specifically to help African American patients self-manage
        chronic sickle cell pain. Aim 1: Modify and\\ntailor the generic cCBT pain
        program, using qualitative research methods to understand the needs and barriers\\nto
        pain management in patients with SCD, as well as the opportunities to engage
        this population using\\nmultimedia. These data will inform the development
        of the features and content of ReThink Pain SCD. Aim 2:\\nConduct a pilot
        pragmatic clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing
        this pain\\nintervention into routine SCD care. Forty patients with SCD will
        be randomized to either receive 8 sessions of\\nthe cCBT program or 8 online
        education modules on a smartphone. Primary outcomes of the trial include\\nfeasibility
        (recruitment, retention, provider and patient feedback) and acceptability
        (sessions completed) of the\\nReThink Pain SCD program.\\nIn order to achieve
        the goals of this research plan and transition to independence, the candidate
        requires\\nfurther training in user-centered design, implementation science,
        design and conduct of pragmatic clinical\\ntrials, and team management and
        leadership. This proposal includes an exceptional team of mentors and\\nconsultants.
        Primary mentor Dr. Bruce Rollman is founding Director of the Center for Behavioral
        Health and\\nSmart Technology. Co-mentor Dr. Robert Noll is a clinical psychologist
        with expertise in behavioral intervention\\ntrials. Co-mentor Dr. Laura De
        Castro is a nationally recognized trialist and expert in sickle cell disease.
        This\\ntraining and research plan will form the basis for a future multicenter
        clinical trial testing the efficacy of ReThink\\nPain SCD for improving pain

        Summary\\nYoung men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV infection
        in the United States, representing\\n80% of all infections among youth ages
        14-24, and 92% of infections among boys ages 14-19. Despite these\\nrisks,
        the field has not even one HIV prevention intervention shown to be effective
        in decreasing sexual risks or\\nincreasing HIV testing among adolescent MSM
        (AMSM). Historically, reaching AMSM for HIV prevention has\\nbeen challenging,
        given their relative geographic isolation and lack of access to traditional
        gay congregating\\nspaces (e.g., bars and many gay-related social networking
        websites). However, our team has developed a novel\\nonline platform for delivering
        interventions to parents of LGB youth that currently sees thousands of visitors
        each\\nyear. HIV prevention advocates have identified parents of AMSM as an
        untapped resource for reducing HIV risk\\nin this population. Parent-child
        communication about sex has well-demonstrated associations with adolescent\\nrisk
        behaviors, and interventions with parents of heterosexual youth have been
        shown to be effective in\\nincreasing parent-adolescent communication, and
        thereby, reducing adolescent health risks. Thus, the goal of\\nthe proposed
        study is to develop an online intervention to increase and improve parent
        communication with\\nAMSM about sexuality and HIV, with the ultimate goal
        of decreasing adolescent sexual risk and increasing HIV\\ntesting. To achieve
        this goal, we proposed four specific aims: (1) Identify the ways to best educate,
        motivate,\\nand guide parents in communicating about sexuality and HIV with
        their sons by conducting interviews and\\nfocus groups with AMSM and their
        parents, (2) Develop a web-based, multimedia, intervention that motivates\\nand
        teaches parents how to communicate effectively with their sons about HIV-related
        topics, (3) Pilot test the\\nacceptability of the intervention and functionality
        of the system, and (4) Conduct a pilot randomized, controlled\\ntrial of the
        intervention. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by collecting interview and focus
        group data from AMSM and\\ntheir parents, and then collaborating with a team
        of parents and adolescent to synthesize existing data, design\\nthe intervention,
        and test its acceptability and functionality. Aim 4 will be achieved by randomizing
        parents who\\ncome to seek resources on our existing website to receive either
        our new intervention or control, and then\\ngathering longitudinal, online
        data from parents in both study arms and their AMSM sons over a 2-4 month\\nperiod.
        Importantly, our study team has already demonstrated the feasibility of (a)
        recruiting parent-AMSM\\ndyads into qualitative research, and (b) utilizing
        our website to enroll parent-AMSM dyads into longitudinal\\nquantitative research.
        Thus, our proposal is innovative in that it uses our existing, proven resources
        to address\\nmany of the barriers that have historically plagued research
        on AMSM and their parents, as well as efforts to\\nintervene with this population.
        If found to be effective, this would be the first ever HIV prevention intervention\\nshown
        to work for AMSM – the population of adolescents who are at highest risk for
        HIV infection.\",\"project_title\":\"Developing an HIV prevention intervention

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nCareer Goal: My career goal is to become a leading epidemiologist
        focused on improving engagement in HIV\\ncare in low and middle income countries
        (LMIC). Through this K99/R00 proposal, I hope to merge my training\\nas an
        epidemiologist with the field of implementation science. With this skill set,
        I plan to build a career focused\\non implementing interventions to retain
        or re-engage HIV-infected women in HIV care in the peripartum period.\\nCareer
        Development: I will focus on training in implementation science and professional
        development during\\nthe mentored (K99) phase of this award. Training in implementation
        science will focus in 3 key areas: 1) core\\nconcepts and theories 2) using
        technology to implement more effective HIV program monitoring systems, and\\n3)
        qualitative research to inform implementation strategies. Professional development
        training will include\\ncoursework, seminars, building my reputation as an
        emerging HIV researcher, and a detailed plan for a\\nsuccessful transition
        to a tenure-track position. Research Project: The scale-up of antiretroviral
        treatment\\n(ART) to all pregnant and breastfeeding women under Option B+
        has the potential to change the trajectory of\\nthe HIV epidemic. However,
        in order for the potential of Option B+ to be realized, women must be retained
        in\\nHIV care and those who are lost to follow-up (LTFU) must be re-engaged
        in care. Few efforts to re-engage\\nwomen in HIV care exist. Routine HIV program
        monitoring is an evidence-based intervention that is vital to\\ntrack women's
        engagement in HIV care under Option B+, but is limited in its ability accurately
        distinguish\\nwomen who are LTFU from those who have transferred to another
        HIV clinic. Identifying women who are LTFU\\nis essential for timely re-engagement
        in HIV care. The goal of the proposed project is to evaluate whether\\nenhancing
        HIV program monitoring with technology may be an implementation strategy to
        accurately identify\\nwomen who are LTFU. The project goal will be achieved
        through the following four Specific Aims: K99/1) To\\nexplore attitudes towards
        using technology for HIV program monitoring, K99/2) To assess the feasibility
        and\\nacceptability of 3 implementation strategies to improve HIV program
        monitoring, R00/3) To evaluate enhanced\\nHIV program monitoring as an implementation
        strategy, R00/4) To evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced\\nprogram monitoring
        to improve the accuracy of HIV program monitoring. Mentorship: A highly accomplished,\\nmultidisciplinary
        team of experts will mentor me in the first two years of this award and provide
        ongoing\\nguidance as I transition to independence. This mentoring team includes:
        Dr. Mina Hosseinipour (Primary\\nMentor, Department of Medicine, UNC; UNC-Project

        breast cancer risk assessment has the potential to distinguish women at higher
        risk who need\\nenhanced screening, preventive or risk-reducing therapies
        and surgeries from women at lower risk who can be\\nspared interventions that
        yield little benefit and may cause harm. Breast cancer risk assessment is
        currently\\nhampered by limited precision and accuracy of existing risk prediction
        models. Women with a family history of\\nbreast (FHBC) have the greatest need
        for better risk assessment as they often receive the same clinical\\nrecommendations
        despite substantial heterogeneity in the underlying risk by the extent of
        FHBC. Integration of\\nmammographic breast density (MBD), a strong and readily
        assessable risk factor for breast cancer, in\\ncombination with detailed FHBC
        data, offers an exceptional opportunity for enhancing existing risk assessment\\nmethods.
        MBD generally declines with age, but the rate of change varies considerably
        between women, and\\nmay be particularly important to breast cancer risk;
        we have demonstrated that women who remain at high\\nMBD over time are more
        likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women whose MBD decreases.\\nAttempts
        to improve risk prediction models by incorporating MBD has had limited success
        as studies have\\nused one-time measures of MBD and included mostly postmenopausal
        women for whom the largest changes\\nin MBD may have already occurred. We
        propose to investigate within-individual changes in MBD over a 10-\\nyear
        period in relation to incident breast cancer by the extent of FHBC (Aim 1),
        and evaluate how changes in\\nMBD may improve several clinical risk prediction
        models (Aim 2) and clinical risk stratification forming the basis\\nfor risk-based
        surveillance and preventive care (Aim 3). We will address these aims by building
        upon the U.S.\\nSister Study, a prospective cohort of 50,884 women with one
        or more sisters diagnosed with breast cancer\\nwho were personally breast
        cancer-free at enrollment in 2003-2009; active annual follow-up is conducted
        for at\\nleast 10 years with each woman. Using a nested case-control design,
        we will retrieve existing mammograms\\nfor all incident breast cancer cases
        diagnosed at ages ≤ 60 years (n=1,242 cases to date) and controls\\nmatched
        on age and enrollment year (2 controls selected per case at the time of case
        identification). We will\\nundertake a comprehensive assessment of MBD, using
        both clinically available qualitative measures used in\\nclinical practice,
        and assessing quantitative measures that allow for measurement of smaller
        changes and\\ndifferent components of MBD (e.g., dense, nondense tissue) that
        are independently associated with breast\\ncancer risk. Our team’s experience
        in leading studies of MBD and prospective available data in the Sister\\nStudy

        to breast cancer risk,\\nmodifiable and genetic factors, and how to use this
        information to enhance risk assessment in women with\\nFHBC. These results

        (provided by applicant):    \\nIn the VA Family Psycho-Educational (FPE) is
        a component of the Uniform Services standard for care of Veterans with schizophrenia
        and their family members. FPE includes single family variants, e.g., Behavioral
        Family Therapy, which is provided to individual families (consumer and family
        members); and multi-family variants, e.g., Multi-Family Group Psycho-Education
        (MFG-stands for 'Multi-Family Group'), which is provided to multiple families
        (consumers and family members together) in a single treatment group. To promote
        the availability of FPE to all Veterans who could benefit, the VA began national
        trainings of clinicians in FPE. Despite this training, the proven effectiveness
        of FPE, and that it is the standard for care, it is not widely available to
        Veterans, is underutilized even where available, and can incur relatively
        high resistance from Veterans and families. Less than 5% of VA Medical Centers
        provide FPE. Further, even where it is available, it reaches a relatively
        small proportion of Veterans who could\\nbenefit. Barriers to receiving this
        treatment include the lack of appropriately trained clinicians,\\nthe need
        for Veterans and family members to travel to receive these services--this
        maybe a particularly important hurdle for a treatment that meets bi- weekly
        for a minimum of nine months--the tendency to avoid in-person treatment due
        to the stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment, and the difficulty
        of providing treatments after hours or on weekends when families are more
        likely be able to attend. It is important for the VA to have treatment delivery
        models that maximize the likelihood that all Veterans in need will receive
        interventions such as FPE, including Veterans residing in rural settings,
        and Veterans who avoid VA settings due to stigma. E-health delivery of services
        has been a focus of the VA as a way to overcome these barriers. Specialized
        web-based approaches have been studied and found to be successful for people
        with schizophrenia, and their families, and can deliver content that is intensive
        and engaging with reduced requirements for staff time. Our previous work has
        developed a model and guidelines to design e-health applications for persons
        with schizophrenia and others with cognitive impairments (e.g., Rotondi, VA
        RR&D D61804R), and developed a highly scalable intervention termed Schizophrenia
        On-line Access to Resources (SOAR) (Rotondi, R01 MH63484). SOAR incorporated
        FPE into a modernized model that: incorporates web-based delivery; provides
        the ability of users to individualize commitment and services to meet varied
        preferences and needs, in order to address prominent reasons for resistance
        to FPE; and is accessible from homes and smart phones. SOAR is highly successful
        at reducing illness symptoms for persons with schizophrenia and improving
        their and their family members' knowledge of the illness. The aims of this
        study are to conduct: 1) a 2-arm non-inferiority randomized comparative effectiveness
        trial of SOAR vs. in-person MFG; 2) exploratory secondary analyses to identify
        Veteran and family characteristics that are associated with decreased levels
        of psychiatric symptoms and caregiver burden; 3) exploratory qualitative analyses
        to inform a larger implementation of SOAR by identifying barriers, facilitators,
        VA system requirements, etc. from clinicians providing the treatments, their
        supervisors, and participants. If successful, SOAR could substantially increase
        the options, availability, utilization, appeal, and effectiveness of FPE for
        Veterans and their families, thereb improving Veteran well-being, recovery,
        and Veteran and family quality of life.\",\"project_title\":\"Comparison of

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems
        associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose,
        increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health
        crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing,
        particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes.
        Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED
        visits\\nresult in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work,
        a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid
        use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies
        to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied.
        Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the\\nED
        by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the
        ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable
        to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter
        on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for
        delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly
        address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited
        during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention
        based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being
        given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive
        voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain
        level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several
        potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message,
        extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most
        helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients,
        the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement
        learning (RL). The RL system will continuously \\\"learn\\\" from the success
        of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select
        the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant
        during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to
        inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance
        an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after
        an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL;
        (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level
        during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention
        on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related
        ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention
        effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical
        opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation.
        This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence,
        to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately,
        this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward
        the field of mobile health.\",\"project_title\":\"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project is a research
        collaboration between the University of Texas at El Paso, The Alliance for
        Border Collaborative and Program Comparers to adapt, implement, and evaluate
        a multi-level, community-based, HIV prevention intervention (Project Encuentro).
        The intervention will target active heroin and crack users and consists of
        increasing access to HIV testing via a social network HIV testing component
        and reducing sexual and drug use risk via a peer network brief behavioral
        Intervention. Encuentro also consists of conducting community awareness meeting
        to target structural factors affecting HIV risk. The intervention was developed
        in an area severely affected by violence and stigma towards drug users, El
        Salvador, which makes it particularly suitable for adaptation to meet the
        needs of drug users living in the proposed intervention site, the U.S.-Mexico
        border. The proposed intervention site also has been severely affected by
        violence which has curtailed any prior attempts to reduce the risk drug users'
        HIV risk. Violence has worsened structural factors which affect HIV risk such
        as, increasing police persecution and stigma and reducing access to resources.
        In our proposed project, we will engage in formative research to understand
        the context of HIV risk of drug users in the border region post violence and
        adapt the intervention accordingly. Findings will allow us to tailor intervention
        components to meet the needs of drug users in the region. Subsequently, we
        propose to test intervention effectiveness and evaluate implementation barriers
        and facilitators. To accomplish our project aims we will use a mixed qualitative,
        quantitative approach. We will begin with a formative phase by conducting
        in-depth interviews with drug users (n = 40) living in the region to understand
        how the context of drug use risk changed as a result of the violence and will
        administer a social network survey (n = 200) to characterize the configuration
        of risk networks. Findings will yield the necessary information to culturally
        adapt the intervention to meet the needs of drug users in the region and will
        help us focus our recruitment efforts where the riskiest networks are located.
        After the intervention is adapted with the help of our community advisory
        board and our community coalition, we will implement the intervention and
        will assess the effectiveness and reach via 6 cross-sectional surveys administered
        to drug users (n=1,200). We will assess the process of implementation by conducting
        ethnographic field notes of all intervention activities including community
        engagement and CAB and coalition meetings. We will assess the fidelity and
        quality of the intervention. Lastly, we will conduct key informant interviews
        with key stakeholders involved in the project and interviews and observations
        will be coded to reflect key systems factors related to successful implementation
        of intervention components in two intervention sites (El Paso, Texas and Ciudad
        Juarez, Mexico). Findings will be highly significant as we will be conducting
        parallel research on the effectiveness of interventions shown to be effective
        in Latino drug users in two very different contexts: El Salvador and the U.S-Mexico
        border. Findings will elucidate implementation challenges and barriers and
        such information can then be used to assess the effectiveness of diverse implementation
        strategies in organizations working to serve the needs of Latino drug users.\",\"project_title\":\"Adaptation

        health care – the splitting of a patient's care across multiple providers

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tammy Chang, MD, MPH, MS is a family
        physician and junior clinical investigator focused on reducing obesity among
        adolescent mothers and their children. Dr. Chang's long-term career objective
        is to reduce health disparities among low-income adolescent mothers using
        tailored eHealth technologies. The objective of this K23 mentored career development
        award includes a 5-year plan for training and research activities that will
        provide the skills and experiences needed to become a successful independent
        investigator. RESEARCH CONTEXT: The United States (US) has one of the highest
        adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world; the majority of pregnant
        adolescents gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess pregnancy weight gain
        has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother,
        increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes
        to long-term obesity for both mother and child. In recognition of this important
        population health problem, both the IOM and AHRQ have identified the development
        of interventions targeting excess pregnancy weight gain as a major research
        priority. Compared to adults, relatively little is known about pregnancy weight
        gain among adolescents. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand
        adolescents' perceptions of and knowledge about pregnancy weight gain, so
        that researchers can customize interventions and make them relevant to the
        pregnant adolescent. The short-term goal of this proposal is to acquire the
        requisite skills to develop an adolescent-centered tailored eHealth intervention
        to reduce excess pregnancy weight gain. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine which
        US pregnant adolescents (aged ≤21 years) are at high risk for significant
        excess pregnancy weight gain; 2) Identify the baselin knowledge, beliefs,
        and factors that influence excess pregnancy weight gain among adolescents;
        and 3) Design and test a scalable healthy diet and exercise eHealth intervention
        tailored to at-risk pregnant adolescents. RESEARCH PLAN: To accomplish these
        aims, Dr. Chang will conduct analyses using nationally representative data
        from the Fragile Families and Wellbeing Study; carry out social media mining
        and corresponding qualitative interviews with pregnant and postpartum adolescents;
        and design, implement, and evaluate an adolescent- centered and tailored eHealth
        (tailored text-messaging) intervention. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Chang
        will broaden her knowledge of advanced statistical methods using a large nationally
        representative dataset; develop skills in mining and analyzing online social
        media data; acquire expertise in designing, implementing, and evaluating scalable
        interventions tailored to pregnant adolescents; and obtain experience in translating
        research findings into clinically relevant policies and practices. Dr. Chang's
        career development goals will be supported through close mentorship from an
        interdisciplinary team; guidance from an expert advisory panel; advanced didactic
        course work; attendance at professional meetings and workshops; participation
        in seminars and journal clubs; guidance in manuscript preparation and grant
        proposal development for projects arising from the research she conducts as
        part of this proposal; and implementing her research plan. This training will
        directly contribute to Dr. Chang's goal of addressing a vital intergenerational
        problem of excess pregnancy weight gain among at-risk adolescents, as well
        as the subsequent submission of a successful R01 application. ENVIRONMENT:
        Dr. Chang's unique resources include a dedicated and accomplished multi-disciplinary
        mentorship team with whom she has previously collaborated; the outstanding
        research infrastructure at the University of Michigan and Department of Family
        Medicine with a particular emphasis on supporting junior investigators; and

        \  \\r\\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   \\r\\nIndividuals living with
        a lower extremity amputation (LEA) often experience relative motion between
        their residual limb and the prosthetic socket, such as vertical translation
        and axial rotation. This motion causes inefficient dynamic load transmission
        from the distal prosthetic components to the residual limb, which can lead
        to significant secondary consequences, such as pain, gait deviations, and
        discomfort that limit mobility and autonomy. Over time, inefficient load transmission
        can lead to elevated forces on the intact joints, which can result in higher
        risk\\r\\nand incidences of degenerative diseases. There is a substantial
        gap in our understanding of the complex mechanics of the residual limb-socket
        interaction during dynamic activities that limit the ability to improve prosthetic
        design. Although assessments of the relative motion between the bone and the
        prosthetic socket have been performed, currently there is little existing
        data on dynamic, in vivo residual limb-socket kinematics. Dynamic Stereo X-ray
        (DSX) is the only currently available technology that can achieve sub- millimeter
        bone pose (position and orientation) estimation accuracy during a wide variety
        of functional movements, but current analytical methods and tools often rely
        on subjective input and are extremely time consuming. DSX is a 3D imaging
        technology for visualizing rapid skeletal movement in vivo. DSX combines 3D
        models of bone morphology derived from computed tomography (CT) scans (required
        to generate the subject specific bone models of the remnant femur for tracking
        skeletal kinematics) with movement data from biplanar x-ray video to create
        highly accurate re-animations of the bone moving in 3D space. It allows for
        the calculation of joint angles and range of motion (ROM) during activity.
        Utilizing DSX, our 2 year goals for this pilot project are to develop and
        validate\\r\\ntime-efficient 3D quantitative functional assessment tools to
        quantify the in vivo kinematics between the residual limb and prosthetic socket,
        in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) of motion for individuals with transfemoral
        amputation. To verify the analytical tools and their relevance to TFA, we
        will evaluate two socket designs: a traditional encapsulated socket and a
        Compression/Release Stabilization (CRS) socket. To do so, the investigators
        will address the following aims: (1) To quantify, in 6 degrees of freedom
        of motion, the relative motion between the residual bone and the prosthetic
        socket during dynamic activities using DSX; (2) To compare comfort, quality
        of life, satisfaction, perceived stability, and ease of use of two lower limb
        socket designs. To address these aims, 5 subjects with TFA will be randomly
        assigned to start the study with their traditional, encapsulated socket or
        a fabricated CRS socket. Each subject will wear the assigned socket for 4
        weeks of home use. After 4 weeks, the process will be repeated with each subject
        utilizing the second socket. After each period of home use, subjects will
        be administered the Trinity Amputations and Prosthetics Experience Scale (TAPES)
        satisfaction scale, and items related to socket comfort and fit drawn from
        both the Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) and Prosthetic Profile
        of the Amputee (PPA). Furthermore, a qualitative assessment will be performed
        through semi-guided interview. Following 8 weeks of home use, each subject
        will then be transported to Providence, Rhode Island (Brown University), where
        a CT scan will be performed and DSX will be utilized to record dynamic X-ray
        sequences during walking at self-selected speed, fast walking (10% faster),
        and sudden stop. Gait and movement data will be collected simultaneously with
        the XROMM during each dynamic task. By developing the analytical tools for
        a highly accurate in-vivo assessment of residual limb-socket motion, we can
        provide vital foundational information to aid in the development of new methods
        and techniques to enhance prosthetic fit that have the potential to reduce
        secondary physical comorbidities and degenerative changes that result from
        complications of poor prosthetic load transmission.   \\r\\n   \\r\\n\",\"project_title\":\"Effect

        Over the last decade, the Veterans' Health Administration (VHA) has shifted
        from providing\\nlong-term and post-acute care in facilities owned and operated
        by states or the VHA, toward contracted care in\\nprivately-owned facilities,
        known as community nursing homes (CNHs). From fiscal years 2000 to 2015,\\nexpenditures
        for CNH care in the VHA expanded from $227 million to $861 million—nearly
        a fourfold increase.\\nMeanwhile, the Office of Inspector General and General
        Accountability Office have raised concerns that the\\nVHA contracts with low-quality
        providers. Through a Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI)-funded\\nCNH
        Dashboard, Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) now have ready access to
        real-time information\\nthat displays data on the quality ratings of facilities
        caring for their Veterans relative to other, non-contracted\\nfacilities in
        the same local market and nationally. However, those data have not been analyzed
        to reveal trends\\nor patterns across VAMCs that could inform VHA's purchasing
        policy and operations. Furthermore, the\\npublicly-reported quality star ratings
        from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have not\\nbeen
        validated for their relevance to important Veterans' outcomes.\\nThe objective
        of the proposed research is to characterize variation in CNH quality as it
        relates to VAMC\\ncharacteristics, Veteran outcomes, and contracting practices.
        Our central hypothesis is that a significant\\nportion of VAMCs have opportunities
        to improve practices related to the purchase of high-quality care for\\nVeterans
        that will lead to improved outcomes by optimizing identifiable contracting
        policies and practices. The\\nsignificance that motivates the proposed project
        is that identifying variation in quality, quantifying potential\\ngains, and
        understanding the policies associated with success within an integrated health
        care system will also\\ncontribute to our general understanding of the use
        of quality information in purchasing policies and practices,\\nan HSR&D priority
        area of long-term care which is of broad concern to health services research
        in this era of\\nvalue based purchasing. The Specific Aims of this proposal
        are to:\\nAim 1. Characterize utilization, cost, and quality of care that
        Veterans receive from VHA-contracted compared\\nto non-contracted community
        nursing homes (CNHs) available in the same market area.\\nAim 2. Determine
        whether utilization of highly-rated CNHs improves outcomes for Veterans.\\nAim
        3. Identify incentive characteristics and contextual factors that contribute
        to purchase of high-quality CNH\\ncare by VAMCs.\\nMethods: Aim 1 will use
        descriptive analysis to compare Veterans' utilization of nursing home care,
        including\\nlength of stay, concentration of Veteran population within individual
        nursing homes, and allocation of care to\\nCNH compared to other VHA long-term
        care and post-acute settings in each study year 2013-2017. Risk-\\nadjusted
        total direct CNH payments per Veteran will be calculated and the relationship
        between price and\\nquality rating will be modeled. For Aim 2 we will estimate
        the effect of increases in quality ratings on Veterans'\\noutcomes. We will
        test the hypothesis that increasing the availability of highly-rated facilities
        among Veterans'\\nCNH options results in fewer hospitalizations and an increased
        likelihood of successful discharge to the\\ncommunity. Using highly-innovative
        analytic technique, potential cost offsets available from reduced\\nhospitalization
        in highly-rated nursing homes will be quantified. Aim 3 will use the analyses
        in Aim 1 to identify\\na sample of VAMCs with variation in relative quality.
        Two in-person site visits and subsequent semi-structured\\ntelephone interviews
        with key VHA and community stakeholders will be conducted and analyzed using
        a\\ngeneral inductive qualitative approach to identify how incentive characteristics
        and contextual factors support\\nor thwart purchase of care from high quality
        CNHs. Results will be used to create a web-based toolkit to inform\\nprogram
        revisions and VHA purchased care policy in general to purchase of high-quality
        CNH Veteran care.\",\"project_title\":\"Are Veterans' Outcomes Better when

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Having completed a BS in Biomedical
        Engineering and a MS, PhD, and post-doctoral fellowship in Epidemiology, Dr.
        Kristin Wall possesses a strong, quantitatively focused foundation in epidemiological
        methods, mathematical modeling, and research evaluating the effectiveness
        of interventions to treat and prevent HIV. Dr. Wall is currently a Research
        Assistant Professor at Emory University and co-Investigator on multiple grants
        to implement and evaluate couples-focused HIV testing and family planning
        interventions in Zambia and Rwanda. She is also Principal Investigator on
        a formative evaluation of pre-exposure prophylaxis acceptability among HIV
        discordant couples in the United States and the Principal Investigator on
        a grant to implement technologies that link patient records across HIV prevention
        and treatment services in Zambia. This K01 application outlines a four-year
        training and research plan structured to systematically expand upon Dr. Wall's
        training and research background to develop a unique, independently funded
        research agenda focused on HIV intervention resource allocation.  Training
        plan: Dr. Wall proposes to gain competency in: 1) using infectious disease
        models for resource allocation, 2) building resource allocation optimization
        programs, and 3) understanding resource allocation decisions in health policy
        and practice. Competency in these areas will be achieved through didactic
        instruction and multidisciplinary mentorship from Dr. Phaedra Corso, an NIH-funded
        researcher and University of Georgia Foundation Professor of Human Health
        with decades of experience in health economic evaluation and translation of
        findings into health policy; Dr. Ron Brookmeyer, an NIH-funded researcher
        and UCLA Professor of Biostatics with extensive experience in HIV epidemic
        modeling and statistics; Dr. David Holtgrave, an NIH-funded Professor at Johns
        Hopkins and world-renowned expert in cost-effectiveness research, resource
        allocation, and health policy for HIV prevention programs; Dr. Arielle Lasry,
        Senior Health Economist at CDC Atlanta whose research focuses on HIV epidemic
        modeling and optimization programming for HIV prevention and treatment resource
        allocation in the United States and Africa; Dr. Gordon Streeb, Professor in
        the Emory Department of Economics and former United States Ambassador to Zambia
        whose work focuses on health economics, policy, development issues in Africa;
        and Dr. Susan Allen, Professor and founder of the Emory-based Rwanda Zambia
        HIV Research Group with more than 25 years of experience working in HIV prevention
        and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa and a successful history of translating
        research findings into national policy in Zambia and\\nRwanda. Dr. Wall will
        seek mentorship within and outside of Emory, where she has already built a
        strong network of research collaborators. As Emory does not currently house
        faculty focused on resource allocation optimization for HIV programs, her
        unique research agenda will be highly complementary to the existing HIV-related
        research portfolio at Emory.  Research plan: Dr. Wall proposes to develop
        methods to optimize the allocation of limited HIV prevention and treatment
        resources to improve a defined health outcome. She will apply these methods
        to answer a relevant, timely, high-impact research question: what is an optimal
        and realistic allocation of combination HIV prevention and treatment resources
        in Zambia to minimize the number of new infections over a given time period?
        Two important resource allocation considerations are the leveraged costs and
        effects of interventions in combination and the realistic facilitators and
        barriers to making funding decisions. Though important, these two considerations
        are rarely systematically incorporated into resource allocation analyses.
        Dr. Wall proposes to advance methods that are inclusive of intervention synergy
        and real-world barriers facing resource allocation decision-makers. Models
        of the Zambian HIV epidemic that output the number of new HIV infections over
        time given a specific resource allocation scenario will be constructed. This
        model will be embedded in an optimization algorithm to minimize the number
        of new HIV infections for the current Zambian budget. Dr. Wall will then conduct
        formative qualitative work to determine the political, social, cultural, and
        ethical factors that influence HIV program resource allocation decision-making
        in Zambia by conducting semi-structured interviews with Ministry of Health
        members and other key stakeholders. Dr. Wall hypothesizes that: 1) the optimization
        model will be sensitive to assumptions of intervention cost-effectiveness
        ratios; 2) the number of HIV infections averted under the actual allocation
        scenario will be significantly lower than that for the optimal scenario; and
        3) factors influencing stakeholder decision-making will include international
        guidelines, historical allocations, and sociocultural attitudes toward individual
        interventions. The proposed research aligns with the NIH Office of AIDS Research,
        NIMH Strategic Research Priorities, and NIMH DAR areas of high priority. The
        project will be the first to incorporate measures of intervention synergy
        and study both the rational and realistic\\nallocation of HIV program resources
        in Zambia. Results will be used as preliminary data for an NIH NIMH R01 (highly
        responsive to PA-14-131) to develop the allocation model in light of changing
        guidelines and formative results. These investigations could inform decision-making
        in Zambia that improves HIV prevention and treatment outcomes. More broadly,
        the results of this work will have important implications for developing evidence-based
        resource allocation methodologies.\",\"project_title\":\"Improving allocation

        (provided by applicant): This Mentored Scientist Career Development Award
        (K01) application proposes a five-year training plan to provide the Candidate
        with the necessary skills and experience for a future R01 submission and transition
        to independent research. The Candidate, Joseph J. Palamar, PhD, MPH, has shown
        dedication to public health through his research on drug use in New York City
        (NYC) and the stigma associated with recreational drug use. He has authored/coauthored
        24 peer-reviewed manuscripts on the topic he seeks to investigate in this
        proposed project.  The scientific objective of this application is to identify
        se and correlates of use of new and emerging drugs in venues which promote
        highest risk for use (e.g., at nightclubs, dance festivals). This research
        is critical because of the unprecedented rise\\nin new psychoactive drugs,
        not currently assessed by national surveys. It is essential for timely identification
        and documentation of the emergence of new drugs and associated adverse effects
        with short-term informing of policymakers, researchers and educators. Rapid
        survey data is needed to contribute to drug monitoring systems and to triangulate
        secondary data, which generally only focus on adverse outcomes of use (e.g.,
        overdose). The development of a survey tool and documentation of an implementation
        approach will allow epidemiologists to triangulate secondary drug data to
        inform prevention strategies, which address use of these continually emerging
        drugs.  Using a 3-phased mixed-methods approach, Dr. Palamar will develop,
        validate and implement a survey tool to monitor use of new and emerging drugs
        among nightclub/dance festival attendees (age 18-25) as they enter venues
        in NYC. Specifically, he will: 1) carry out formative research to inform survey
        instrument development (N=40 key informant interviews), 2) design and validate
        an initial (longer) survey with online follow-up (N=250), based on the key
        informant interviews, and 3) implement a validated rapid survey (N=500) based
        upon the initial survey reliability and validity results. Through these research
        activities, Dr. Palamar will identiy and characterize use of new and emerging
        drugs among nightclub and dance festival attendees. Specifically, he will
        aim to: 1) identify and describe the current user population and potential
        user population (as per intent to use), 2) identify and describe frequency
        of use, contexts of use, modes of administration, and perceived availability,
        3) examine how use and intention to use relate to use of other drugs and perceived
        contact with users and dealers, and 4) examine socio-demographic and attitudinal
        correlates of use and intention to use, reasons for use, effects from use
        and perceived risk associated with use.  The Candidate has developed a strong
        team of mentors to train him throughout the proposed grant period. His mentors
        and consultants are from diverse backgrounds and experts in drug epidemiology,
        public health, qualitative methods and biostatistics. His Mentor, Dr. Scott
        Sherman, and Co-Mentors, Dr. Danielle Ompad and Dr. Michele Shedlin, will
        be fundamental to the Candidate's development into an independent substance
        abuse researcher. Mentoring will take place in conjunction with coursework
        and participation in seminars and conferences. Throughout this training plan
        the Candidate will: 1) enhance his ability to develop and conduct his own
        independent research study; 2) expand his expertise in drug use epidemiology;
        3) learn time-space and venue-based sampling methodologies; 4) expand his
        knowledge and experience in the design, validation and implementation of surveys,
        which will lead to real-time data, and 5) become more advanced in analysis
        and dissemination of survey data. These goals will foster the Candidate's
        career development and expertise in drug epidemiology and contribute to the
        publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts that will inform prevention science
        and lead to an eventual R01.  The proposed project will take place at the
        New York University School of Medicine, Department of Population Health, which
        has a multidisciplinary research team and integrates ground-breaking research
        with training for the next generation of leaders in public health. The Department
        is committed to training new researchers and promoting development of independent
        investigators. The Candidate will collaborate with epidemiologists at the
        NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and use their secondary data to
        inform and triangulate his survey data. The proposed research plan combined
        with the extensive resources of the institutional environment and the strong
        institutional support for the Candidate's professional development will assure
        successful implementation of this award.  This carefully documented mixed-method
        approach will allow researchers to collect real-time data on new and emerging
        drug trends in nightlife scenes, and quickly inform the scientific community
        and the public about the use, dangers and correlates of new and emerging drugs.
        This information is essential to prevent increasing use and associated adverse
        effects and mortality associated with use of these unstudied drugs. Results
        will also inform prevention strategies, larger-scale studies (e.g., R01s)
        that compare patterns of emergence across US cities, and drug monitoring systems
        (e.g., local, national), enabling them to track use and associated adverse
        consequences of use in a more comprehensive manner.\",\"project_title\":\"Development

              "abstractText" : "Advances in transportation systems, fueled by on-demand mobility-platforms, crowd-sourcing, ride-hailing and increasing automation, promise to enhance the livability and competitiveness of cities and rural areas globally. A fundamental question is whether these innovations will contribute to solving, or inadvertently exacerbate, critical challenges such as congestion, emissions and inequitable access to mobility. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) research addresses a gap in current approaches by integrating quantitative and qualitative multi-disciplinary insights and developing methods to study how society adapts to evolving mobility technologies. Integrating insights from the social sciences in existing passenger and logistics system models will help understand how adoption behaviors are affected by diverse community beliefs and culture in rapidly changing mobility contexts. This research will have far-reaching effects, delivering new tools to tailor transformative mobility solutions to citizens' needs, decongest urban networks and expand mobility to underserved communities. The project includes educational efforts where students evaluate engineering solutions that align with human behavior and livability goals. The project will also develop online educational material and training tools for Chicago high school teachers, to promote careers in engineering in diverse communities. \n\nThe goal of this project is to establish a new foundation and develop methods to better understand and predict impacts of emerging freight and passenger mobility adoption. Specifically, this research establishes an analytical community mobility adoption framework that integrates current quantitative theory, data and methods (i.e. formal surveys, discrete choice analysis and supervised learning) with qualitative social science perspectives (theory of social thresholds, ethnographic data on neighborhood-scale mobility behavior). Robust policy guidance tools derived through combining qualitative, participatory, multi-stakeholder research methods and formal policy scenario simulation are expected to inform communities' transition resulting from the potentially disruptive socio-technical changes in transportation mobility choices. The impact will be strengthened by integration with education and outreach approaches that inspire, challenge and educate future civil engineers to address mobility challenges with technically informed and culturally sensitive designs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Criminal courts that operate under the same formal law and policy often develop their own norms and practices, resulting in very different kinds of justice outcomes depending upon where a case is adjudicated. And when formal legal policies change, the reforms generally get implemented in distinct and divergent ways by local court actors, sometimes in ways inconsistent with policy goals. This project capitalizes upon recent major policy changes imposed in the federal criminal system by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to examine how different court \"communities\" have responded to the changes. Specifically, new policies have been developed urging prosecutors to focus on certain kinds of federal crimes, and that require prosecutors across the country to maximize the potential punishment. While the DOJ policies aim for standardized prosecutorial practices across the diverse federal district courts, prior research suggests that local courts will vary in how they translate these directives into action.  \n \nThe study builds directly upon the PI's previous NSF-funded research that examined jurisdictional differences in adjudication strategies in federal court, using both qualitative field methods and quantitative methods. The project revisits the same research sites (4 geographically and demographically diverse federal districts) to assess whether and how the current DOJ policy impacts caseload characteristics (including defendant demography) and adjudication practices and outcomes, with a focus on how formal top-down policy is translated into localized, on-the-ground legal action. Using interviews, observations, and administrative data from the federal courts, the project tests three related hypotheses: 1) Despite the return to policies that aim to control local practices through top-down mandates, adaptations will be localized in practice. Between-district variations will continue to be evident in four distinct sets of practices: case selection; prosecutorial charging practices; terms and modes of plea agreements; and formal sentencing practices. 2) Within-district, demographic composition of the caseload, the application of prosecutorial-controlled sentencing tools, and sentence lengths will change as a function of temporal period, but local adjudication norms will temper such change. 3) The degree of change in local practice norms will be greater in the current policy period (beginning May, 2017) than the previous one (2010-2017) because the current policy authorizes increased punishment for defendants and includes local compliance mechanisms.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite these frequent attributions, there is scant empirical evidence about how people view the role of luck in their lives, and how these views vary across the population. This proposal will analyze how people define luck, their views about the influence of luck on individual outcomes, and the aspects of their lives, e.g., financial success, job status, health, personal relationships, to which they apply luck. A critical component of the research will evaluate the extent to which people attribute socioeconomic outcomes to luck as compared with individual talents and effort. A better understanding of these perceptions will shed new light on views about social inequality, the factors that lead to success and failure, and individual motivations. These findings will provide new information to help individuals in society reflect upon the relative roles of luck, talent, and effort as reasons for their own outcomes as well as the outcomes for others in society.    \n \n \nThis proposal will conduct in-depth, open-ended interviews with a broadly representative national sample of 100 U.S. adults. Data will include age, socioeconomic status, race, military experience, health history, political affiliation, and gender. Data analysis will be conducted using ATLAS.ti. Following the general principles of grounded theory and abductive analysis, all interviews will be coded for primary patterns of response identifying general themes and key variations among participant groups. These findings will lay the foundation for a better understanding of how people view the determinants of success in their own life trajectories as well as for others. The findings will inform a variety of sociological theories seeking to understand the origins of inequality and how these origins play out across the life course.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship provides an emerging scholar-scientist with an opportunity to investigate the ways in which diverse Black families navigate the racial socialization of their youth in the 21st century. The well-being of Black children in the United States is a matter of grave public health significance. The unfortunate realities of Ferguson, MI, Baltimore, MD, Sanford, FL, Charleston, SC, McKinney, TX, Cleveland, OH, and Chicago, IL, have left many in our society with questions about how to provide youth with the triumvirate \"affection, protection, and correction\"  required to optimize their psychosocial wellbeing. Racial socialization (RS) is a process that has been associated with a number of positive outcomes. However, this research has largely assessed Black mothers (of mother-father households), has predominately used survey data, and has focused on retrospective reporting of RS, limiting our conceptual understanding of a crucial parenting practice. This project addresses these limitations, expanding the study of RS in a number of important ways.\n\nThe project, entitled the \"Black Family Racial Socialization Project\" focuses on the development of three studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods, from the perspective of both parents and youth. The primary aim of the first study is to use survey and interview methods to elucidate the ways in which Black families representing a diverse structural spectrum (e.g., extended kin, blended families, LGBT couples) prepare themselves to undertake the RS of their children. The primary aim of the second study is to capture the synergistic and bidirectional nature of RS \"in the moment\", by using media (e.g., TV scenes, song lyrics, social media posts) to create and code ecologically-valid, family-level racial socialization conversations. The primary aim of the third study is to prospectively assess how Black parents and Black parents-to-be anticipate teaching their children about race \"in the future\". This study will utilize annual interviews and biannual surveys to monitor how intentions to socialize Black youth (and actual socialization behaviors) change over time, and to elucidate the principal factors that instigate such changes. Together, this research will lead to the development of a more complete conceptual framework that can be tested and instituted in future investigations. In addition, the findings from this research are expected to contribute to the development of effective interventions for Black families.",

              "abstractText" : "With Big Data comes the need for succinct data summaries that are easy to visualize and understand. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a particular suite of computational tools for summarizing and visualizing shape in high-dimensional data sets. These tools have been used in recent years to guide new discoveries in cancer research, neuroscience, materials science, image analysis, and many areas where shape, broadly construed, is of importance. However, by summarizing data in a succinct way certain important differences between data sets can often go undetected. This project provides a new mathematical framework for precisely measuring how lossy the most popular methods in TDA are. By developing new ways for quantifying how large-scale differences go undetected, the project offers enrichments of current topological methods to obtain novel data science tools with greater distinguishing power. The awarded funds will go primarily to fund a graduate student to aid the PI in basic research and development of these enriched topological summaries. Computational experiments on data sets of public interest, e.g. time-varying socio-economic indicators and weather data, will be carried out to test performance of these tools against current state of the art methods. Additionally, the PI will incorporate these novel methods into the data science curriculum at the PI's host institution and recruit students from historically under-represented groups to be trained as the nation's next generation of data scientists.\n\nThis project is an ambitious extension of earlier work undertaken by the PI and provides a targeted attack on the inverse problem for the main objects of study in topological data analysis: the merge tree, which tracks how connected components of the sub-level set of a function evolves; Reeb graphs, which tracks connected components of the fiber of a function; and the barcode/persistence diagram, which is a collection of intervals/points in the plane that represent an algorithmic pairing of critical points of a function on a space. The PI showed in earlier work how merge trees determine the associated barcode and provided a precise enumeration of how many distinct merge trees have the same barcode. By identifying functions on the real line that are related by an orientation preserving coordinate transformation, the PI showed how a novel enrichment of the merge tree---the chiral merge tree---faithfully captures these equivalence classes of functions and offers exponential distinguishing power over the barcode for time-series analysis. This project aims to carry out similar analysis for functions on surfaces, with an eye toward improving the classification performance of persistent homology in image analysis, and for Reeb graphs, to better integrate with level-set persistent homology. By carrying out a careful study of inverse problems in each of these settings, novel enrichments analogous to the chiral merge tree will be developed. Additionally, to make these enriched topological summaries useful for data classification tasks, novel metrics will be defined for comparing each of these summaries and algorithms will be developed for the efficient computation of these metrics.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

International development groups refer to these as \"child marriages\" and consider them to be damaging to well-being, particularly for girls. Therefore, with wide support from Western nations, including the United States, significant resources are invested in campaigns to eradicate these practices. However, this movement has also been critiqued for relying on a notion that there is a clear and absolute boundary between childhood and adulthood that lies at 18 years. In fact, there is surprisingly little objective information available about why \"child marriage\" remains prevalent in some places despite its purported harmful consequences. The research supported by this award will address this question. Results from the project will support policy recommendations, and contribute to a wider critical engagement with the notion that early transitions to adulthood are necessarily harmful in all circumstances. \n\nResearch will be carried out in north western Tanzania among a Sukuma population where around one-third of girls marry before 18 years. Data collection will take place within a demographic surveillance site managed by the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research. Taking a mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected over a two-year period. To build an understanding of early marriage grounded in ethnographic reality, rather than stereotype, the project will first utilize focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify perceived risks to wellbeing that characterize female adolescence and the role of early marriage in elevating or mitigating such risk. Multiple dimensions of female wellbeing (physical and mental health, education, food security, empowerment, and community respect) will then be assessed via a large quantitative survey, and analyzed to determine if 18 years emerges as a meaningful threshold demarcating harmful marriage, or whether alternative age categorizations, if any, better predict variation in wellbeing. Quantitative and qualitative data will then be used test the hypotheses that early marriage is either the product of parental coercion and a parent-offspring conflict of interests, or whether it is better understood as a parental strategy to enhance the success of daughters. Finally, the project will quantify associations between age at menarche, first reproduction and marriage to explore hypothesized links between physiological and behavioral transitions into adulthood. The project includes the mentorship of an American Postdoctoral Scholar, research experience opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and capacity building for longer-term international collaborative research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Fundamentally new approaches that are designed specifically to address the challenges of limited-resource settings are needed. Utilizing paper as a substrate to develop biosensors is attractive because the resources required to produce them are minimal and the materials are ubiquitous and inexpensive.  This project will create new device designs that can enable paper-based biosensing.  Hydrophilic (wettable) channels will be patterned in paper using hydrophobic (non-wettable) barriers in order to control the transport of sample fluids by wicking.   In addition to devising a new strategy for bioanalysis in limited-resource settings, the broader impacts of this research program include the creation of educational opportunities for middle school students (hands-on workshops), high school students (device design challenges and summer internships), and science teachers (classroom kit development).\n\n\nDue to their low cost and ease of use, paper-based microfluidic devices have gained attention as a platform to develop point-of-use bioassays. Independent of the advances in assay development, the paper-based devices themselves, in spite of their vast potential to facilitate bioanalysis, have received surprisingly little attention. This project aims to build an integrated research and education program centered on developing novel paper-based microfluidic devices that can facilitate biosensing based on chemical and biochemical reactions that occur at the interfaces formed between converging liquid fronts. Devices exploiting this approach will facilitate multiplexed biosensing using assay formats that are traditionally considered to be incompatible with flow-based devices (e.g., chemical reactions). The central hypothesis of this research is that the material properties of the paper (e.g., porosity) and the transport of reaction products (e.g., by diffusion) will ultimately control the analytical performance of these paper-based biosensors. By studying these variables systematically, new strategies for low-cost, paper-based biosensing will be developed. Assays at fluidic interfaces will result in the formation of visible colors that will allow users to easily interpret the results of an assay via visual threshold (qualitative), visual comparisons of intensities to read guides (semi-quantitative), or with image analysis (quantitative). This research is significant because the devices derived from this program span a broad range of applications in bioanalysis and will serve as versatile tools for all forms of analytical chemistry. Potential applications include: (i) environmental monitoring of heavy metals, (ii) food security and nutrient density, (iii) detection of nucleic acids and proteins, and (iv) the development of diagnostic assays that are designed specifically for use in limited-resource settings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Participants will receive coaching to prepare for graduate school and professional development, and they will be mentored into becoming independent creative thinkers and researchers. Participants will gain experience in scientific dissemination and communication, including publishing in professional conferences and journals, and giving scientific presentations.\n\nLong range HF communications work by the reflection of radio waves by the ionosphere layer of the atmosphere. These communications can travel around curvature of the earth, and work without the need for significant infrastructure like satellites, cellular networks, internet, etc. The challenge with HF communications is that propagation via the ionosphere may be unreliable, the ionospheric conditions may change very rapidly, and different frequencies have different propagation characteristics via the ionosphere. Successful communication depends on the time of day, location of users, selection of frequency, modulation, antenna type, and power level.

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\n\nFor the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Garden State LSAMP (GSLSAMP) program was established in 2009 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of New Jersey.  The eight public and private institutions that make up the GSLSAMP are diverse and include one community college and seven four-year institutions, including one private institution.  The institutions are Essex County College, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University New Brunswick and Newark, and William Paterson University.  The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) graduates with STEM degrees by 60% over the next five years.  This goal will be accomplished by integrating GSLSAMP efforts and proven best practices into institutional, local and regional efforts that encourage success in STEM including learning communities, research experiences, academic bootcamps, collaboration with the community colleges of the Northern New Jersey Bridges to the Baccalaureate, research conferences and advisement. It will also increase the number of urban minority students from GSLSAMP institutions pursuing graduate education and international experiences by 20% through integrated research experiences and graduate school preparation and advisement.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"\n\nThe knowledge generating research study seeks to understand the factors and mechanisms related to the GSLSAMP's successes in increasing the participation of URM students in STEM from several common and uncommon sources and their subsequent graduation with an undergraduate STEM degree.  The studies will potentially reveal the factors and mechanisms in the STEM academic pipeline that increase URM students' interests and efforts in pursuing graduate training and a career in STEM, which will lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.

              "abstractText" : "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a serious complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is the leading cause of kidney failure. Yet, it is still not clear how the many underlying chemical, physical, and biological processes interact to damage the kidneys during diabetes. It is challenging to monitor the damage to the kidneys inside a patient. The regions of the kidney that are damaged are very small and are deep within the body. It takes a long time for irreversible damage to accumulate to the point where non-invasive urine samples contain detectable quantities of proteins that leaked through the kidneys. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will connect several processes that have been shown individually to contribute to injury in kidneys due to diabetes into a sophisticated computer simulation. This computational tool will aid in understanding how the processes interact and how diabetic kidney damage begins and changes over time. In the long-term, results from this project will help to predict the impacts of many competing factors on kidney health during diabetes management. The computer simulation produced in the project can also be used to test and optimize treatments to slow the progression of DKD. The project also will involve a set of educational activities related to the scientific work. Several undergraduate and graduate students including women and underrepresented minorities will work with the PI to conduct the research and educational activities. Educational modules related to the research will be delivered to a variety of groups including K-12 students, college students, and grandparents. Physical models of kidney tissues will be 3D-printed and shared with students and educators. The activities will expose many students and members of the public to biomedical engineering and computational science through engaging scientific demonstrations and interactive experiences.\n\nThe principal investigator's long-term career goal is to develop multiscale computational models to enhance understanding of the mechanisms governing tissue remodeling and damage as a result of diseases and infections and to simulate the treatment of those conditions to improve human health.  Toward this goal, this project will develop a novel computational approach for studying diabetic kidney disease (DKD) through a virtual kidney that can be used like a powerful, non-invasive microscope to look into the body to detect and monitor damage to the glomeruli (where most damage occurs) during the onset and progression of diabetic complications in the kidney. The virtual kidney platform will use multiscale computational modeling to connect effects at different length scales from smaller to larger: inside cells, between adjacent cells, across a single glomerulus, and among collections of glomeruli interacting with other tissues in a kidney. A hybrid computational approach will take advantage of the benefits of stochastic differential equations to describe chemical species that react and interact in large quantities and of agent-based models to describe cells and chemical species that interact in small quantities or in qualitative up- or down-regulation fashions.  The Research Plan is organized under two aims.  The FIRST AIM is to formulate cellular level mathematical models of biochemical cell signaling networks responsible for damage in each of the three main glomerular zones: a) podocytes, b) mesangial cells and mesangial matrix and c) endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane.  Computational tools will be developed for importing biochemical networks, conducting uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, and validating model results for the three zones.  To assess validity, computational models will be compared to experimental evidence gleaned from the literature. The SECOND AIM is to build a virtual kidney computational model focusing on crosstalk, structural, and hemodynamic effects on the primary tissue compartments within multiple nephrons.  Steps include:  a) constructing a hybrid computational model for tissue level simulation of glomerular cells that combines information from reactions in single cells, connects multiple interacting cells and transports glucose and other molecules through the mesangium and the glomerular filtration barrier; b) connecting the glomerular models to a tubule and vessel centric-model for blood flow and filtration regulation and c) validating the virtual kidney model and simulating responses to stimuli.  A user-friendly interface will be created for specifying model input and stimuli, running the simulations, and visualizing results.  Simulations of the virtual kidney model will be rigorously compared to pharmacological, physiological, and histological data, primarily from humans.  After model validation to a subset of the data cases, in silico experiments will be conducted to predict the magnitudes and rates of change for glomerular injury outcomes including proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under DKD pathophysiological conditions.  The metric for success will be the accurate simulation of the classic trajectory of onset and progression of DKD subject to clinically relevant input and stimuli.  Computational tools and code developed will be distributed openly via GitHub repositories, which may be of broad interest to the systems biology research community using SBML and/or CompuCell3D.  In summary, the project addresses the critical need to compile the multiple mechanistic processes that contribute to DKD onset and progression into a user-friendly systematic framework capable of taking the interconnected chemical, physical, and biological factors into account in a coupled fashion and in the appropriate magnitudes and sequences to make testable predictions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The researcher will develop a comparative study of three cities: Belfast, Melbourne, and Bombay. She will focus on the microbe, the colonial administrator, and the bacteriologist as the central actors in each of the three cases. She will do so by engaging in a study of archival documents and other sources to obtain a deeper understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that make each region unique. She plans to show how specific features of the local environment in these three regions, when combined with plans of sanitary improvement and land use change espoused by the British Empire, served to produce unique environments in which particular microbes thrived. The proposed project draws from multiple disciplinary sources and is intended for multiple disciplinary audiences. The researcher plans to disseminate her research results at conferences and workshops sponsored by history departments, epidemiology and public health departments, public health policy centers, and organizations that engage in climate studies.\n\nThis project uses a historical frame while engaging with a number of central topics in the field of science and technology studies. It engages with the concept of nonhuman agency with its focus on the ecological specificity of microbes, and it uses Niche Construction Theory to access the localized environments and to draw out their relationship to microbial actors. Cultural construction of science and technology, particularly as it relates to imperialism and nineteenth century colonial practices, will also be an important element of consideration to this project. Using relatively new social scientific frameworks to guide this history, this project will engage with STS in its goal to induce new consideration of the agency of living objects and actor-network theory as a viable historical and social scientific frame.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The strategy will be to study a demonstrated successful learning model that integrates traditional high school STEM curriculum with real world projects from the STEM business community. The study will illuminate how the components of the program work together to support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers, in particular female and minority students. The findings of the study will make it possible to implement the program in similar contexts across the nation. A better understanding of experiential learning within a public school district context can potentially impact tens of thousands of students. \n\nThe goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory case study of Blue Valley Center for Advanced Professional Studies (BVCAPS) which is the founding location of the Center for Advanced Professional Studies (CAPS) network. CAPS will provide programming that includes STEM capstone experiences (in medicine, bioscience, technology, or engineering) for public school high school juniors and seniors. Guided by the theoretical and conceptual constructs of social cognitive career theory and high-quality project-based learning, this study will seek to answer the following research questions: 1) How does the CAPS model support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers? 2) What aspects of the BVCAPS model contribute to increased female and under-represented minority student motivation and preparation for STEM careers? The qualitative exploration will be used to create a set of validated and reliable instruments that can be used to study this and similar programs more broadly as they relate to motivation and preparation for STEM careers. This study will build on the literature in high school STEM education in the area of project-based learning and capstone experiences in high school and add to the developing literature on high school STEM experiential learning. Measurement tools created by this study will enable examination of the capstone model in programs within the network of schools (over 10,000 students in more than 80 school districts within 13 states across the US) and more broadly. In addition to the potential impact of the measurement tools themselves, the findings of this study will address how other STEM educators can support the motivation and preparation for students in STEM careers, in particular female and minorities. Information gleaned in this area will help advance high school STEM reform and preparation for post-secondary careers and learning opportunities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Training engineering faculty in engineering education research expands the number of faculty adopting research-based instructional practices in their courses, and results in improved teaching, advising, programming, and policy-making by closing the research-to-practice gap.\n\nWhile previous mentorship models have focused on the content of engineering education as a field, this work identifies effective strategies from successful mentoring relationships that incorporate the social and cultural components of becoming an engineering education researcher. By conducting qualitative interviews of engineering faculty and engineering education researchers mentee-mentor pairs, the study the study develops a conceptual model of the formation of engineering education researchers' identity. This model clarifies how researchers undergo a paradigm shift and potential career pivot to expand their expertise in a related, but distinct, discipline of engineering education. This novel approach provides important information to enhance existing training materials and to develop additional training opportunities for engineering faculty who are interested in conducting engineering education research.

This project will capitalize on the societal interest in cybersecurity and cryptography and explore how the skills that underlie the encrypting and decrypting practices in cryptography parallel the skills that children must develop to become successful readers and writers. Given the importance of cryptography and cybersecurity, the project will introduce a new technology-enhanced STEM education model for engaging children of 7-10 years old, particularly girls, in cryptography and cybersecurity building and STEM identity development as they make and break secret codes. The mystery of the subject, its relevance in today's society, and interactive learning experiences will engage children, and the after-school environment where the project will be performed will provide a safe space for them to learn at their own pace. The important scientific and educational outcomes will include improved understanding of how literacy, self-efficacy, computational thinking, 21st century skills, and interest in cryptography and cybersecurity can be fostered at the elementary school level.\n\nThe focus of this project is to conduct a systematic investigation of the effective conditions for designing and implementing touch-screen enhanced visuospatial learning curricula that foster STEM interest and career awareness using the unique context of cryptography. An interdisciplinary team of K-12 after-school teacher leaders, education technologists, special educators, computer scientists, and STEM education researchers will design a 6-week, 24-hour program of cryptography focused apps and activities for upper elementary students (grades 3-5) in after-school programs that serve primarily girls and African American students. To encourage adoption and facilitate dissemination, the Codebreakers curriculum will be available online in the form of an interactive, touch-friendly website. A mixed-method research design will employ a range of methods including phenomenology, comparative case studies, pretest-posttest analyses, and mixed-effects modeling. The project will use qualitative data to explore students' and teachers' perceptions and experiences with the Codebreakers activities and technology. Quantitative data will be used to make inferences regarding the quantifiable impacts of the strategy on the development of students' self-efficacy, interest and identity in STEM, evolution of their understanding of cryptography and cybersecurity, and the development of their morphological awareness. Ongoing professional development (PD) and support will be provided face-to-face during bi-weekly meetings with teacher leaders and using the Codebreakers online social network.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\n\nSRI International (SRI) in partnership with Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall) will conduct an efficacy study of a new comprehensive science curriculum for middle grades 6-8 called Amplify Science Middle School (ASMS). This school science curriculum integrates disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. The overarching aim of the study will be to understand the impact of the curriculum on student achievement, classroom implementation, and teacher practice in relation to the recommendations of \"A Framework for K-12 Science Education\" and the Next Generation of Science Standards. While the number of states fully adopting NGSS hovers at around 20, nearly another 20 states have either incorporated the Framework or substantial portions of the NGSS into their state frameworks. Currently, the number of curriculum materials that have been designed for the Framework are relatively few, and thus the efficacy evidence basis for NGSS-designed curricula is limited. As more and more curriculum materials become available for supporting the Framework vision, the science education field needs rigorous research on the efficacy of curricula and the conditions required to implement them. ASMS is the Hall's first comprehensive 6-8 grade curriculum that has been designed specifically to meet the vision of the Framework and NGSS. Field trials of ASMS with more than 475 teachers and 34,000 students in a wide variety of settings, including urban, rural and suburban schools, have shown positive impact on student achievement, providing a compelling reason for a large-scale efficacy trial at this time.\n\nThe study will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods within an experimental design that will allow the examination of relations between contextual factors and student learning gains to help explain the results. Thus, this study will be important for moving education researchers toward increased understanding of how to meaningfully study and support teaching and learning in districts that will be trying to implement the next generation of science curriculum materials. Work will be conducted in districts with large numbers of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields so that educators can better understand the promise of NGSS-aligned curricula in promoting access and equity in science education. The research team will conduct a random assignment efficacy study in 7th grade classrooms beginning in academic year 2018-19 and following up with these students as 8th graders in academic year 2019-20. Teachers in both conditions will receive professional development on the NGSS; teachers in the treatment condition will also receive professional development in the use of the ASMS materials. The recruiting target is a sample of 48 middle schools within up to 6 medium to large districts in California and/or Washington. The researchers will attempt to recruit all middle schools and all 7th grade\nscience teachers in a district. It is anticipated that each school will have an average of two teachers teaching 3 sections of 7th grade science with 30 students per section for an approximate total of 96 teachers and 8,640 students. All students should have opportunities to learn science. This study will aim to draw valid inferences about the impact of curricula in districts with high concentrations of students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. This work will also contribute to the larger, nationwide effort to support standards-based instructional reforms in science by helping to identify conditions needed for successful implementation of NGSS-designed curriculum materials. The findings will provide an important basis for investments in new curriculum materials and will be of strong interest to those in science education and the learning sciences, as well as to district leaders and policymakers concerned with scaling up of rigorous curriculum.",

Ordinarily, the term fraud is applied to illegal behavior. Globally, however, fraud allegations seem increasingly to provide a more general language to express extreme dissatisfaction with both instiutions and individuals for actions that range from the merely misleading to the truly unlawful. This research investigates why the use of the language of fraud has expanded, the political and social effects this entails, and how people re-build trust in the wake of perceived betrayals. The research is important because trust is necessary for healthy economies and robust democratic political systems. Research findings will therefore be of interest to both policy makers and citizens who seek to promote civic participation and economic development.\n\nThe research will be undertaken in the conjoined cities of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia. This site was chosen due to Bolivia's long history of donor-sponsored (including American-backed) rule-of-law reforms and concurrent projects encouraging entrepreneurship and the financial inclusion of the poor. Indeed, Bolivian fraud accusations frequently sit at the intersection of these two objectives: urging people to embrace entrepreneurship to lift themselves from poverty and ongoing efforts to stem economic crimes. The project builds on the researcher's decade-long fieldwork in Bolivia, allowing for longitudinal analyses and comparative data collection and the efficient use of funding. The researcher will gather data through a combination of qualitative research methods, including ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and archival research. Interviews will be conducted with regulatory officials, jurists, foreign donors, and NGO representatives to investigate the priority given to economic crimes and specifically fraud as an object of intervention. Archival data will provide insights into shifting regulations, historic pyramid scheme cases, and patterns in criminal cases related to fraud. Ethnographic research will focus on pyramid schemes and quasi-legal multilevel marketing companies. Findings from this research will illuminate the history, uses, and effects of fraud accusations and contribute to social science theory of fraud as a changing global category.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The main goal of this project is to teach machines to understand human language when it contains spatial information. For example, to understand the statement, \"Give me the book on AI on the table to your left,\" a robot needs to understand that the first \"on\" expresses the topic of the book, while the second \"on\" and the rest of the sentence convey spatial information. Next, it needs to work out the visual meaning of \"on\" to identify the correct book. Spatial language understanding is challenging because it requires meaning disambiguation, recognizing the links between referenced objects, and in most cases, background knowledge and common sense. This is particularly true for more complex sentences that include nesting relations or idioms containing spatial terms, like \"she is the top expert in her field.\" The goal of this research is to develop techniques for the integration of machine learning and reasoning to advance spatial language comprehension. Solving this problem will provide tangible benefits to society in a wide variety of applications including healthcare (e.g., extracting biomedical information from patient reports and images), navigation and communication with assistant robots (particularly in risky situations like firefighter robots), situational awareness, information retrieval systems using various types of data, and geographical information systems.\n\nProviding reasoning capabilities to machine learning models is highly challenging. The proposed research advances this issue in an important and broad sub-problem: spatial language understanding. To this aim, a generic domain-independent symbolic spatial meaning representation will be introduced, which covers the main spatial semantic concepts for a variety of tasks. Deep structured and relational learning techniques will be developed to obtain such representations. The proposed techniques will facilitate indirect supervision by exploiting visual resources, will use ontologies that convey common sense and will integrate the axioms of spatial qualitative reasoning in training structured representations. Such an approach helps to avoid massive and complex data annotation for training structured and complex models. This research will evaluate whether using formal spatial calculi models as an intermediate structured representation will improve spatial reasoning and deeper learning. The interaction between learning and spatial reasoning will be investigated, while exploiting both symbolic and sub-symbolic representations. The impact of integrating explicit spatial reasoning will be tested on textual and visual question-answering tasks with a focus on locative questions. The outcome of this research will advance the generalizability of current state-of-the-art deep learning models at a time when there is a lack of training examples for complex unobserved situations. This work will help bridge the gap between symbolic AI and deep ML to advance spatial language understanding. The project will support research and education for graduate and undergraduate students and increase the contribution of women and minorities in STEM.\n\nThis award is jointly funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research in the Office of Integrative Activities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Much of science is found in peer-reviewed journals. However, researchers in the history or sociology of science cannot study what is accepted and what is rejected in these journals because until recently they did not have access to a body of data that included accepted and rejected manuscripts, the topics covered, the characteristics of those who submitted manuscripts, and the comments of the reviewers.  Moreover, they did not have such data over time, so that they might see changes within a discipline in terms of topics and submitters.  The American Sociological Association (ASA) has electronic copies of all the manuscripts and all the reviews for ASA journals for a twenty-year period between 1991 and 2010.  Based on a prior three-year, NSF-funded project, the Center for Social Science Research (CSSR) at the George Mason University has created a Digital Archive that contains this information for the American Sociological Review, the ASA top journal.   Given the complexities of the Archive data file, CSSR will hold a two-day workshop so that interested scholars can be trained to use it to answer critical questions about the history and development of sociology in a time-period of pronounced changes in the discipline.  Faculty trained on the use of the archive will pass on this knowledge to their colleagues in sociology and other disciplines to further the study of the peer-review system for a flagship journal. This project is beneficial because it allows for scrutiny of the scientific process.\n\nThis project will support a two-day workshop to be held in April 2019 to train faculty and graduate students in the use of the ASA/Mason American Sociological Review (ASR) Digital Archive.  The Center for Social Science Research (CSSR) at the George Mason University has created a Digital Archive of more than 8,000 manuscripts and 26,000 reviews. The Archive includes demographic and institutional information of authors and reviews over a 20-year time-span.  The Archive was created by examining all submitted manuscripts, matching them with reviewers, and using the internet to secure other information about authors and reviewers. This information was merged into four types of files, including author, reviewer, person, and manuscript information. Workshop participants will become familiar with the files and learn how to link them and/or how to use each separately, depending on the research question to be answered. Examining these files allows researchers to determine whether the peer networks of reviews are intellectually distant from those of authors, or whether both the author and the reviewer are in the same networks, thus suggesting the potential for reviewer bias.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The phenomenon of language shift, in which a community ceases to speak their heritage language in favor of another (typically more socially and economically prestigious) language, has long been of interest to linguists and anthropologists. For immigrants to the United States and other countries, it is an often-repeated \"rule\" that language shift typically occurs by the third generation (i.e., the grandchildren of the original immigrants). This project, which trains a student in rigorous, empirically-grounded methods of data collection and analysis in cultural and linguistic anthropology, asks what factors might contribute to influence language shift among an earlier generational cohort. Additionally, the researcher explores whether there are grammatical, phonological or other patterns that can be identified in first-generation language shift, and how speakers navigate overlapping identities in the new cultural context. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in linguistics and anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to improve public understanding of indigeneity, language shift, and multilingualism. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and contributes to the education of underrepresented groups. \n\nUnder the supervision of Dr. Mary Bucholtz at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Anna Bax will work with a selected cohort of Mixtec women who grew up in Ventura County, California to understand how they variably use Spanish, English, and Mixtec for identity construction purposes. In Ventura County, the majority of the indigenous immigrant community is of Mixtec heritage and speak Mixtec languages, which are native to southern Mexico and differ radically from Spanish. This linguistic and anthropological project explores the question of how young women in this diasporic community, who may face gendered expectations to maintain their heritage language and culture, navigate the accelerated process of first-generation language shift. It seeks to address the following research questions: (1) How is Mixtec identity linguistically constructed, even as many community members are losing the ability to speak Mixtec entirely? How can Spanish and English linguistic resources come to symbolize Mixtec identity in the wake of this loss? (2) What strategies do individual participants use to navigate community language shift, and how do they balance their overlapping identities as indigenous Mexicans and as new members of American society? The researcher will take a case-study approach, using linguistic-anthropological and sociophonetic methods to explore how these young women maintain strong links to their indigenous identity, even as some of them have lost the ability to speak their heritage language. Participant-observation and ethnographic interviews will be conducted with this focal set of youth, as well as with key members of their social networks. In order to collect rich, detailed data about the participants' varying linguistic repertoires, they will also audio-record their own speech practices in naturalistic interaction in different social settings, so as to document shifts in their use of the focal linguistic variables and their performances of indigenous identity. The researcher will conduct a quantitative sociophonetic analysis of one Spanish and one English linguistic variable, with a focus on the connections of these variables to indigenous identity and how the use of the variables differs across social contexts. The participants' speech will also be compared to a corpus of local Chicanas' speech to understand the social construction of linguistic difference and/or similarity. Qualitative discourse-analytic methods will be used to understand the social meanings attached to these variables, as well as the meaning of participants' Mixtec code-switching practices. The results of this research will benefit local community centers who are invested in the maintenance of indigenous languages, and will be used to inform local public and educational policymaking about linguistic diversity. In addition, the project directly benefits the young indigenous participants, most of whom are current college students, by centrally involving them in STEM research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Throughout its five years, this project will support two cohorts of 16 students who are pursuing baccalaureate degrees in Materials Science and Engineering, as well as Civil, Chemical, Electrical, Environmental, and Mechanical Engineering. Cohort-building activities will include an academic boot camp before the students' first college semester, and courses taken by all cohort members. The project will provide a monthly seminar series on topics such as internships, industry mentoring, undergraduate research, and international exchange programs. The project's activities have been positively linked to academic success. This project aims to achieve broader impact by contributing to state and federal strategic workforce diversification goals. Project activities that support these goals include engineering outreach programs and courses on engineering design for K-12 educators. It is expected that the project will generate new knowledge about how engineering education can be improved to better serve the growing number of lower-income, academically talented students entering college. The project will educate graduates who are prepared to directly enter graduate school or work in industry, thus contributing to developing a diverse, flexible, and well-educated STEM workforce. \n\nA mixed-methods research design will be used to study the effects of implemented practices on the self-efficacy and engineering identity of the student cohorts. The explicit research objective is to add to existing knowledge about student characteristics and issues that help low-income, academically high-achieving students succeed in engineering and related disciplines. This project will  fill gaps in knowledge about the development of self-efficacy and engineering identity in low-income, academically talented students. The project will also identify the most effective combinations of curricular and co-curricular activities that strengthen individual students' self-efficacy and identity, with the goal of developing intervention techniques that retain engineering majors through graduation and placement in industry or graduate school. Quantitative measurable outcomes will include increased student retention, increased cohort self-efficacy and identity statistics, higher-than-average graduation rates for the cohorts using evidence-based programs, and successful placement in industry or graduate school.  Qualitative measurable outcomes, determined by participant interviews and surveys, will include attainment of academic and personal goals, increased leadership skills and confidence levels, and established sense of community. These outcomes will be an important contribution to knowledge about recruitment and retention of low-income, academically high-achieving students in the engineering disciplines.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While these solutions have merits, they often place the burden of creating more gender inclusive organizations on women themselves. A more effective approach to enhance gender inclusivity is to understand the role that male leaders may play in supporting women's advancement within organizations. While many male leaders may understand the importance of supporting female leaders, they may not know how to effectively do so. This proposal seeks to identify effective behaviors of male champions for female leadership and for supporting gender equality in organizations. This research highlights ways in which males can contribute to gender inclusivity at work. Results from this project can inform organizations about how to influence, train, and encourage possible male champions to actively support female leadership in the workplace. \n\nMale champions, or male leaders who value diversity in the workplace and support advancing talented females to leader positions, have a critical role to play as agents of change to enhance gender equality. The purpose of this project is to identify the effective behaviors of male champions. Multiple studies that utilize different research designs and methods will be conducted to examine these behaviors. First, we will conduct a qualitative study, which utilizes interviews with male champions and those who have been supported by male champions, to determine key gender inclusive leadership behaviors.

              "abstractText" : "The research supported by this award examines how ordinary citizens, national governments, and international organizations make use of accusations of fraud.  Ordinarily, the term fraud is applied to illegal behavior. Globally, however, fraud allegations seem increasingly to provide a more general language to express extreme dissatisfaction with both instiutions and individuals for actions that range from the merely misleading to the truly unlawful. This research investigates why the use of the language of fraud has expanded, the political and social effects this entails, and how people re-build trust in the wake of perceived betrayals. The research is important because trust is necessary for healthy economies and robust democratic political systems. Research findings will therefore be of interest to both policy makers and citizens who seek to promote civic participation and economic development.\n\nThe research will be undertaken in the conjoined cities of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia. This site was chosen due to Bolivia's long history of donor-sponsored (including American-backed) rule-of-law reforms and concurrent projects encouraging entrepreneurship and the financial inclusion of the poor. Indeed, Bolivian fraud accusations frequently sit at the intersection of these two objectives: urging people to embrace entrepreneurship to lift themselves from poverty and ongoing efforts to stem economic crimes. The project builds on the researcher's decade-long fieldwork in Bolivia, allowing for longitudinal analyses and comparative data collection and the efficient use of funding. The researcher will gather data through a combination of qualitative research methods, including ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and archival research. Interviews will be conducted with regulatory officials, jurists, foreign donors, and NGO representatives to investigate the priority given to economic crimes and specifically fraud as an object of intervention. Archival data will provide insights into shifting regulations, historic pyramid scheme cases, and patterns in criminal cases related to fraud. Ethnographic research will focus on pyramid schemes and quasi-legal multilevel marketing companies. Findings from this research will illuminate the history, uses, and effects of fraud accusations and contribute to social science theory of fraud as a changing global category.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Short-term environmental disturbances and long-term environmental change have displaced millions worldwide. The US Gulf Coast region is especially vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes, sea level rise, land subsidence, and flooding. Some parishes in Louisiana have lost over 90% of their land, largely due to environmental changes. What socioeconomic and cultural factors influence perceptions of environment risk and migration? This project investigates factors not traditionally associated with the environment, including ties to place, strong social relationships, and counter perceptions of environmental risk, that might keep people in place, despite environmental risk. Migration theory suggests that behavior is largely linked to economic factors, such as income opportunities or life ambitions. This research, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, will investigate whether, and to what extent, environmental perceptions impact movement decisions. Improved understanding of movement decisions can inform local and state decision makers, yielding more precise composite descriptions of their constituents and likely behavioral outcomes, enabling better prediction of migration patterns and strategic planning. Environmental perceptions are also of value to the emergency and first-response communities when they confront new environmental dangers. The ability to better communicate environmental risk or danger can ultimately help to save lives.\n\nCharlotte Till, under the supervision of Dr. Shauna BurnSilver of Arizona State University, will explore the relationship between risk perceptions and migration decisions. This research will be conducted in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, an ideal setting for studying risk where there are both acute and chronic stressors on movement behavior. Hurricanes pose a severe seasonal threat to this area, but sea level rise and land subsidence represent cumulative risks and a new everyday reality for coastal people. During pilot study work in the area in 2016 the researchers found that relative to younger residents, older residents had less intention to leave despite known risks, and factors such as home, family, or community were important features of the environment. Based on survey and interview methodologies this research will first identify how the environment is perceived, and then investigate the influence of these perceptions on movement decisions. Survey responses will form the baseline data representing local perceptions, and then a subset of respondents will be invited to interviews allowing the investigator to explore movement logic(s) and the significance of identified influence factors for their decision making. Text analysis tools will be used to analyze interview data. Examples of the insights possible through the findings of this work include: how movement decisions are made, what factors result in place attachment outweighing risk, and how environmental factors interact with movement decisions. By actively incorporating individuals who do not move, this project is targeting an understudied but critical group for analyzing human movement patterns. By drawing participants directly from the parish this research may spur greater public engagement with science, contributing toward greater public scientific literacy. This research contributes to development of the migration literature on the role of the environment in movement decisions and factors impacting those decisions. This project will also facilitate improved understanding and engagement among communities, emergency managers, and municipal respresentatives.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The main goal of this project is to teach machines to understand human language when it contains spatial information. For example, to understand the statement, \"Give me the book on AI on the table to your left,\" a robot needs to understand that the first \"on\" expresses the topic of the book, while the second \"on\" and the rest of the sentence convey spatial information. Next, it needs to work out the visual meaning of \"on\" to identify the correct book. Spatial language understanding is challenging because it requires meaning disambiguation, recognizing the links between referenced objects, and in most cases, background knowledge and common sense. This is particularly true for more complex sentences that include nesting relations or idioms containing spatial terms, like \"she is the top expert in her field.\" The goal of this research is to develop techniques for the integration of machine learning and reasoning to advance spatial language comprehension. Solving this problem will provide tangible benefits to society in a wide variety of applications including healthcare (e.g., extracting biomedical information from patient reports and images), navigation and communication with assistant robots (particularly in risky situations like firefighter robots), situational awareness, information retrieval systems using various types of data, and geographical information systems.\n\nProviding reasoning capabilities to machine learning models is highly challenging. The proposed research advances this issue in an important and broad sub-problem: spatial language understanding. To this aim, a generic domain-independent symbolic spatial meaning representation will be introduced, which covers the main spatial semantic concepts for a variety of tasks. Deep structured and relational learning techniques will be developed to obtain such representations. The proposed techniques will facilitate indirect supervision by exploiting visual resources, will use ontologies that convey common sense and will integrate the axioms of spatial qualitative reasoning in training structured representations. Such an approach helps to avoid massive and complex data annotation for training structured and complex models. This research will evaluate whether using formal spatial calculi models as an intermediate structured representation will improve spatial reasoning and deeper learning. The interaction between learning and spatial reasoning will be investigated, while exploiting both symbolic and sub-symbolic representations. The impact of integrating explicit spatial reasoning will be tested on textual and visual question-answering tasks with a focus on locative questions. The outcome of this research will advance the generalizability of current state-of-the-art deep learning models at a time when there is a lack of training examples for complex unobserved situations. This work will help bridge the gap between symbolic AI and deep ML to advance spatial language understanding. The project will support research and education for graduate and undergraduate students and increase the contribution of women and minorities in STEM.\n\nThis award is jointly funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research in the Office of Integrative Activities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make walking both safer and easier for transfemoral amputees. Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The phenomenon of language shift, in which a community ceases to speak their heritage language in favor of another (typically more socially and economically prestigious) language, has long been of interest to linguists and anthropologists. For immigrants to the United States and other countries, it is an often-repeated \"rule\" that language shift typically occurs by the third generation (i.e., the grandchildren of the original immigrants). This project, which trains a student in rigorous, empirically-grounded methods of data collection and analysis in cultural and linguistic anthropology, asks what factors might contribute to influence language shift among an earlier generational cohort. Additionally, the researcher explores whether there are grammatical, phonological or other patterns that can be identified in first-generation language shift, and how speakers navigate overlapping identities in the new cultural context. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in linguistics and anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to improve public understanding of indigeneity, language shift, and multilingualism. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and contributes to the education of underrepresented groups. \n\nUnder the supervision of Dr. Mary Bucholtz at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Anna Bax will work with a selected cohort of Mixtec women who grew up in Ventura County, California to understand how they variably use Spanish, English, and Mixtec for identity construction purposes. In Ventura County, the majority of the indigenous immigrant community is of Mixtec heritage and speak Mixtec languages, which are native to southern Mexico and differ radically from Spanish. This linguistic and anthropological project explores the question of how young women in this diasporic community, who may face gendered expectations to maintain their heritage language and culture, navigate the accelerated process of first-generation language shift. It seeks to address the following research questions: (1) How is Mixtec identity linguistically constructed, even as many community members are losing the ability to speak Mixtec entirely? How can Spanish and English linguistic resources come to symbolize Mixtec identity in the wake of this loss? (2) What strategies do individual participants use to navigate community language shift, and how do they balance their overlapping identities as indigenous Mexicans and as new members of American society? The researcher will take a case-study approach, using linguistic-anthropological and sociophonetic methods to explore how these young women maintain strong links to their indigenous identity, even as some of them have lost the ability to speak their heritage language. Participant-observation and ethnographic interviews will be conducted with this focal set of youth, as well as with key members of their social networks. In order to collect rich, detailed data about the participants' varying linguistic repertoires, they will also audio-record their own speech practices in naturalistic interaction in different social settings, so as to document shifts in their use of the focal linguistic variables and their performances of indigenous identity. The researcher will conduct a quantitative sociophonetic analysis of one Spanish and one English linguistic variable, with a focus on the connections of these variables to indigenous identity and how the use of the variables differs across social contexts. The participants' speech will also be compared to a corpus of local Chicanas' speech to understand the social construction of linguistic difference and/or similarity. Qualitative discourse-analytic methods will be used to understand the social meanings attached to these variables, as well as the meaning of participants' Mixtec code-switching practices. The results of this research will benefit local community centers who are invested in the maintenance of indigenous languages, and will be used to inform local public and educational policymaking about linguistic diversity. In addition, the project directly benefits the young indigenous participants, most of whom are current college students, by centrally involving them in STEM research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Gender equality is recognized as an important factor in catalyzing development and lifting communities out of poverty. Empowered women contribute to healthy and productive families, communities, and nations. An important step in doing this is to integrate high quality and timely gender analysis (examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and opportunities affect men, women, girls and boys in specific contexts), into decision-making and project planning. For both public and private sectors, early, action-oriented gender analysis is vital to tackle improve outcomes. In 2015 - 2016, OECD aid agencies spent, on average, $41.7 billion per year targeting gender equality and women's empowerment. Conservatively estimating that 3-5% of this expenditure is for gender analysis and action planning, that makes a market of $1.3-2.1 billion in the development sector alone. This project can potentially improve outcomes from that development funding.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a web-based application that automates the currently manual process of conducting gender analyses. This addresses a real world challenge faced by aid organizations to effectively integrate gender analyses into planning to inform effective and timely decision-making. Despite being a requirement by many organizations, there are procurement and contract delays, shortage of gender experts, and manual research and data collection.  This project will develop a machine learning model that leverages big data, APIs, and text-mining, driven by an analytic framework created by experts, to automate this process and deliver customized results instantly for a fraction of the cost. Phase I will build, train, and test the model for one sector and select countries. By the end of Phase I, the model will be tested and iterated to meet high quality control standards. Once validated, it will be ready to scale globally across sectors.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To achieve these objectives, the project will support students through: (1) curricular engagement via linked courses that use evidence-based pedagogies; (2) community building through collaboration in common spaces and social activities; and (3) meaningful mentorship experiences. The project will systematically assess potential barriers to student success to determine what barriers exist for individual students with unique intersecting identities.  It will measure the impact of these barriers on students' sense of belonging and academic success, as measured by retention and graduation rates.

In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.\n\nA two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment. Finally, the workshop will catalyze new research collaborations, projects, and funding proposals related to engineering practice. Workshop activities will incorporate discussions of missing voices and contexts in the literature to identify critical areas for future research that supports broadening participation. Anticipated outcomes include an editorial or position piece on the current state of research on engineering education and actionable guidelines for future research, an edited volume or special issue of a journal comprised of papers or commentaries on engineering education and practice, and a workshop summary report. A special session during the 2018 FIE conference is also planned, to share highlights from the workshop, provide preliminary guidance on methods and approaches for research on engineering practice, and further grow the community of interest among a larger number of potential participants.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.\n\n\nThe core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Advances in transportation systems, fueled by on-demand mobility-platforms, crowd-sourcing, ride-hailing and increasing automation, promise to enhance the livability and competitiveness of cities and rural areas globally. A fundamental question is whether these innovations will contribute to solving, or inadvertently exacerbate, critical challenges such as congestion, emissions and inequitable access to mobility. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) research addresses a gap in current approaches by integrating quantitative and qualitative multi-disciplinary insights and developing methods to study how society adapts to evolving mobility technologies. Integrating insights from the social sciences in existing passenger and logistics system models will help understand how adoption behaviors are affected by diverse community beliefs and culture in rapidly changing mobility contexts. This research will have far-reaching effects, delivering new tools to tailor transformative mobility solutions to citizens' needs, decongest urban networks and expand mobility to underserved communities. The project includes educational efforts where students evaluate engineering solutions that align with human behavior and livability goals. The project will also develop online educational material and training tools for Chicago high school teachers, to promote careers in engineering in diverse communities. \n\nThe goal of this project is to establish a new foundation and develop methods to better understand and predict impacts of emerging freight and passenger mobility adoption. Specifically, this research establishes an analytical community mobility adoption framework that integrates current quantitative theory, data and methods (i.e. formal surveys, discrete choice analysis and supervised learning) with qualitative social science perspectives (theory of social thresholds, ethnographic data on neighborhood-scale mobility behavior). Robust policy guidance tools derived through combining qualitative, participatory, multi-stakeholder research methods and formal policy scenario simulation are expected to inform communities' transition resulting from the potentially disruptive socio-technical changes in transportation mobility choices. The impact will be strengthened by integration with education and outreach approaches that inspire, challenge and educate future civil engineers to address mobility challenges with technically informed and culturally sensitive designs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Findings from this research are used to develop training materials and inform a networking event intended to pair engineering faculty interested in engineering education research with potential mentors at different institutions.  Training engineering faculty in engineering education research expands the number of faculty adopting research-based instructional practices in their courses, and results in improved teaching, advising, programming, and policy-making by closing the research-to-practice gap.\n\nWhile previous mentorship models have focused on the content of engineering education as a field, this work identifies effective strategies from successful mentoring relationships that incorporate the social and cultural components of becoming an engineering education researcher. By conducting qualitative interviews of engineering faculty and engineering education researchers mentee-mentor pairs, the study the study develops a conceptual model of the formation of engineering education researchers' identity. This model clarifies how researchers undergo a paradigm shift and potential career pivot to expand their expertise in a related, but distinct, discipline of engineering education. This novel approach provides important information to enhance existing training materials and to develop additional training opportunities for engineering faculty who are interested in conducting engineering education research.

              "abstractText" : "Criminal courts that operate under the same formal law and policy often develop their own norms and practices, resulting in very different kinds of justice outcomes depending upon where a case is adjudicated. And when formal legal policies change, the reforms generally get implemented in distinct and divergent ways by local court actors, sometimes in ways inconsistent with policy goals. This project capitalizes upon recent major policy changes imposed in the federal criminal system by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to examine how different court \"communities\" have responded to the changes. Specifically, new policies have been developed urging prosecutors to focus on certain kinds of federal crimes, and that require prosecutors across the country to maximize the potential punishment. While the DOJ policies aim for standardized prosecutorial practices across the diverse federal district courts, prior research suggests that local courts will vary in how they translate these directives into action.  \n \nThe study builds directly upon the PI's previous NSF-funded research that examined jurisdictional differences in adjudication strategies in federal court, using both qualitative field methods and quantitative methods. The project revisits the same research sites (4 geographically and demographically diverse federal districts) to assess whether and how the current DOJ policy impacts caseload characteristics (including defendant demography) and adjudication practices and outcomes, with a focus on how formal top-down policy is translated into localized, on-the-ground legal action. Using interviews, observations, and administrative data from the federal courts, the project tests three related hypotheses: 1) Despite the return to policies that aim to control local practices through top-down mandates, adaptations will be localized in practice. Between-district variations will continue to be evident in four distinct sets of practices: case selection; prosecutorial charging practices; terms and modes of plea agreements; and formal sentencing practices. 2) Within-district, demographic composition of the caseload, the application of prosecutorial-controlled sentencing tools, and sentence lengths will change as a function of temporal period, but local adjudication norms will temper such change. 3) The degree of change in local practice norms will be greater in the current policy period (beginning May, 2017) than the previous one (2010-2017) because the current policy authorizes increased punishment for defendants and includes local compliance mechanisms.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite these frequent attributions, there is scant empirical evidence about how people view the role of luck in their lives, and how these views vary across the population. This proposal will analyze how people define luck, their views about the influence of luck on individual outcomes, and the aspects of their lives, e.g., financial success, job status, health, personal relationships, to which they apply luck. A critical component of the research will evaluate the extent to which people attribute socioeconomic outcomes to luck as compared with individual talents and effort. A better understanding of these perceptions will shed new light on views about social inequality, the factors that lead to success and failure, and individual motivations. These findings will provide new information to help individuals in society reflect upon the relative roles of luck, talent, and effort as reasons for their own outcomes as well as the outcomes for others in society.    \n \n \nThis proposal will conduct in-depth, open-ended interviews with a broadly representative national sample of 100 U.S. adults. Data will include age, socioeconomic status, race, military experience, health history, political affiliation, and gender. Data analysis will be conducted using ATLAS.ti. Following the general principles of grounded theory and abductive analysis, all interviews will be coded for primary patterns of response identifying general themes and key variations among participant groups. These findings will lay the foundation for a better understanding of how people view the determinants of success in their own life trajectories as well as for others.

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship provides an emerging scholar-scientist with an opportunity to investigate the ways in which diverse Black families navigate the racial socialization of their youth in the 21st century. The well-being of Black children in the United States is a matter of grave public health significance. The unfortunate realities of Ferguson, MI, Baltimore, MD, Sanford, FL, Charleston, SC, McKinney, TX, Cleveland, OH, and Chicago, IL, have left many in our society with questions about how to provide youth with the triumvirate \"affection, protection, and correction\"  required to optimize their psychosocial wellbeing. Racial socialization (RS) is a process that has been associated with a number of positive outcomes. However, this research has largely assessed Black mothers (of mother-father households), has predominately used survey data, and has focused on retrospective reporting of RS, limiting our conceptual understanding of a crucial parenting practice. This project addresses these limitations, expanding the study of RS in a number of important ways.\n\nThe project, entitled the \"Black Family Racial Socialization Project\" focuses on the development of three studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods, from the perspective of both parents and youth. The primary aim of the first study is to use survey and interview methods to elucidate the ways in which Black families representing a diverse structural spectrum (e.g., extended kin, blended families, LGBT couples) prepare themselves to undertake the RS of their children. The primary aim of the second study is to capture the synergistic and bidirectional nature of RS \"in the moment\", by using media (e.g., TV scenes, song lyrics, social media posts) to create and code ecologically-valid, family-level racial socialization conversations. The primary aim of the third study is to prospectively assess how Black parents and Black parents-to-be anticipate teaching their children about race \"in the future\". This study will utilize annual interviews and biannual surveys to monitor how intentions to socialize Black youth (and actual socialization behaviors) change over time, and to elucidate the principal factors that instigate such changes. Together, this research will lead to the development of a more complete conceptual framework that can be tested and instituted in future investigations. In addition, the findings from this research are expected to contribute to the development of effective interventions for Black families.",

              "abstractText" : "With Big Data comes the need for succinct data summaries that are easy to visualize and understand. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a particular suite of computational tools for summarizing and visualizing shape in high-dimensional data sets. These tools have been used in recent years to guide new discoveries in cancer research, neuroscience, materials science, image analysis, and many areas where shape, broadly construed, is of importance. However, by summarizing data in a succinct way certain important differences between data sets can often go undetected. This project provides a new mathematical framework for precisely measuring how lossy the most popular methods in TDA are. By developing new ways for quantifying how large-scale differences go undetected, the project offers enrichments of current topological methods to obtain novel data science tools with greater distinguishing power. The awarded funds will go primarily to fund a graduate student to aid the PI in basic research and development of these enriched topological summaries. Computational experiments on data sets of public interest, e.g. time-varying socio-economic indicators and weather data, will be carried out to test performance of these tools against current state of the art methods. Additionally, the PI will incorporate these novel methods into the data science curriculum at the PI's host institution and recruit students from historically under-represented groups to be trained as the nation's next generation of data scientists.\n\nThis project is an ambitious extension of earlier work undertaken by the PI and provides a targeted attack on the inverse problem for the main objects of study in topological data analysis: the merge tree, which tracks how connected components of the sub-level set of a function evolves; Reeb graphs, which tracks connected components of the fiber of a function; and the barcode/persistence diagram, which is a collection of intervals/points in the plane that represent an algorithmic pairing of critical points of a function on a space. The PI showed in earlier work how merge trees determine the associated barcode and provided a precise enumeration of how many distinct merge trees have the same barcode. By identifying functions on the real line that are related by an orientation preserving coordinate transformation, the PI showed how a novel enrichment of the merge tree---the chiral merge tree---faithfully captures these equivalence classes of functions and offers exponential distinguishing power over the barcode for time-series analysis. This project aims to carry out similar analysis for functions on surfaces, with an eye toward improving the classification performance of persistent homology in image analysis, and for Reeb graphs, to better integrate with level-set persistent homology. By carrying out a careful study of inverse problems in each of these settings, novel enrichments analogous to the chiral merge tree will be developed. Additionally, to make these enriched topological summaries useful for data classification tasks, novel metrics will be defined for comparing each of these summaries and algorithms will be developed for the efficient computation of these metrics.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "In some societies, traditional marriage customs may produce brides and grooms under the age of 18. International development groups refer to these as \"child marriages\" and consider them to be damaging to well-being, particularly for girls. Therefore, with wide support from Western nations, including the United States, significant resources are invested in campaigns to eradicate these practices. However, this movement has also been critiqued for relying on a notion that there is a clear and absolute boundary between childhood and adulthood that lies at 18 years. In fact, there is surprisingly little objective information available about why \"child marriage\" remains prevalent in some places despite its purported harmful consequences. The research supported by this award will address this question. Results from the project will support policy recommendations, and contribute to a wider critical engagement with the notion that early transitions to adulthood are necessarily harmful in all circumstances. \n\nResearch will be carried out in north western Tanzania among a Sukuma population where around one-third of girls marry before 18 years. Data collection will take place within a demographic surveillance site managed by the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research. Taking a mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected over a two-year period. To build an understanding of early marriage grounded in ethnographic reality, rather than stereotype, the project will first utilize focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify perceived risks to wellbeing that characterize female adolescence and the role of early marriage in elevating or mitigating such risk. Multiple dimensions of female wellbeing (physical and mental health, education, food security, empowerment, and community respect) will then be assessed via a large quantitative survey, and analyzed to determine if 18 years emerges as a meaningful threshold demarcating harmful marriage, or whether alternative age categorizations, if any, better predict variation in wellbeing. Quantitative and qualitative data will then be used test the hypotheses that early marriage is either the product of parental coercion and a parent-offspring conflict of interests, or whether it is better understood as a parental strategy to enhance the success of daughters. Finally, the project will quantify associations between age at menarche, first reproduction and marriage to explore hypothesized links between physiological and behavioral transitions into adulthood. The project includes the mentorship of an American Postdoctoral Scholar, research experience opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and capacity building for longer-term international collaborative research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The use of modern instrumentation for biochemical analysis is impractical in limited-resource settings where electrical power and trained operators may not be available and where analytical solutions must be low-cost, portable, and operationally simple. Fundamentally new approaches that are designed specifically to address the challenges of limited-resource settings are needed. Utilizing paper as a substrate to develop biosensors is attractive because the resources required to produce them are minimal and the materials are ubiquitous and inexpensive.  This project will create new device designs that can enable paper-based biosensing.  Hydrophilic (wettable) channels will be patterned in paper using hydrophobic (non-wettable) barriers in order to control the transport of sample fluids by wicking.   In addition to devising a new strategy for bioanalysis in limited-resource settings, the broader impacts of this research program include the creation of educational opportunities for middle school students (hands-on workshops), high school students (device design challenges and summer internships), and science teachers (classroom kit development).\n\n\nDue to their low cost and ease of use, paper-based microfluidic devices have gained attention as a platform to develop point-of-use bioassays. Independent of the advances in assay development, the paper-based devices themselves, in spite of their vast potential to facilitate bioanalysis, have received surprisingly little attention. This project aims to build an integrated research and education program centered on developing novel paper-based microfluidic devices that can facilitate biosensing based on chemical and biochemical reactions that occur at the interfaces formed between converging liquid fronts. Devices exploiting this approach will facilitate multiplexed biosensing using assay formats that are traditionally considered to be incompatible with flow-based devices (e.g., chemical reactions). The central hypothesis of this research is that the material properties of the paper (e.g., porosity) and the transport of reaction products (e.g., by diffusion) will ultimately control the analytical performance of these paper-based biosensors. By studying these variables systematically, new strategies for low-cost, paper-based biosensing will be developed. Assays at fluidic interfaces will result in the formation of visible colors that will allow users to easily interpret the results of an assay via visual threshold (qualitative), visual comparisons of intensities to read guides (semi-quantitative), or with image analysis (quantitative). This research is significant because the devices derived from this program span a broad range of applications in bioanalysis and will serve as versatile tools for all forms of analytical chemistry. Potential applications include: (i) environmental monitoring of heavy metals, (ii) food security and nutrient density, (iii) detection of nucleic acids and proteins, and (iv) the development of diagnostic assays that are designed specifically for use in limited-resource settings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Long range HF communications allow wireless communication over thousands of kilometers without the need for satellites, and are of immeasurable importance to military and government, aviation, air-to-ground communications, maritime services, public safety and civil service distress communications, space and satellite operations, weather stations, FM and TV broad casting, and many other communication needs. This REU site will provide participating students a high quality, immersive, and hands-on learning experience in this exciting area. Participants will receive coaching to prepare for graduate school and professional development, and they will be mentored into becoming independent creative thinkers and researchers. Participants will gain experience in scientific dissemination and communication, including publishing in professional conferences and journals, and giving scientific presentations.\n\nLong range HF communications work by the reflection of radio waves by the ionosphere layer of the atmosphere. These communications can travel around curvature of the earth, and work without the need for significant infrastructure like satellites, cellular networks, internet, etc. The challenge with HF communications is that propagation via the ionosphere may be unreliable, the ionospheric conditions may change very rapidly, and different frequencies have different propagation characteristics via the ionosphere. Successful communication depends on the time of day, location of users, selection of frequency, modulation, antenna type, and power level.  This project will generate new solutions to key problems that will enable more dependable and efficient long range HF communications. Specifically this project will investigate and develop: (i) New designs for spectrum agile radios for high frequency communications that can switch communication parameters such as modulation, coding, pulse shape, equalizer, power, etc.; (ii) Machine learning algorithms that can learn the best communication parameters for changing channel conditions; (iii) Low profile antennas that can be used in HF communications; (iv) Software and algorithms to predict network level connections that are possible ahead of time; (v) Qualitative and quantitative Ionospheric communications models; (vi) Flexible and automatic antenna tuning circuits; and (vii) Smart algorithms that can learn from their past experiences in varying Ionospheric conditions, weather situations, time and location.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\n\nFor the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Garden State LSAMP (GSLSAMP) program was established in 2009 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of New Jersey.  The eight public and private institutions that make up the GSLSAMP are diverse and include one community college and seven four-year institutions, including one private institution.  The institutions are Essex County College, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University New Brunswick and Newark, and William Paterson University.  The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) graduates with STEM degrees by 60% over the next five years.  This goal will be accomplished by integrating GSLSAMP efforts and proven best practices into institutional, local and regional efforts that encourage success in STEM including learning communities, research experiences, academic bootcamps, collaboration with the community colleges of the Northern New Jersey Bridges to the Baccalaureate, research conferences and advisement. It will also increase the number of urban minority students from GSLSAMP institutions pursuing graduate education and international experiences by 20% through integrated research experiences and graduate school preparation and advisement.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"\n\nThe knowledge generating research study seeks to understand the factors and mechanisms related to the GSLSAMP's successes in increasing the participation of URM students in STEM from several common and uncommon sources and their subsequent graduation with an undergraduate STEM degree.  The studies will potentially reveal the factors and mechanisms in the STEM academic pipeline that increase URM students' interests and efforts in pursuing graduate training and a career in STEM, which will lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.  An external evaluation team will implement both quantitative and qualitative instruments to assess the overall quality of the programs on the individual campuses as well as the entire alliance related to the overall goals of the project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a serious complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is the leading cause of kidney failure. Yet, it is still not clear how the many underlying chemical, physical, and biological processes interact to damage the kidneys during diabetes. It is challenging to monitor the damage to the kidneys inside a patient. The regions of the kidney that are damaged are very small and are deep within the body. It takes a long time for irreversible damage to accumulate to the point where non-invasive urine samples contain detectable quantities of proteins that leaked through the kidneys. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will connect several processes that have been shown individually to contribute to injury in kidneys due to diabetes into a sophisticated computer simulation. This computational tool will aid in understanding how the processes interact and how diabetic kidney damage begins and changes over time. In the long-term, results from this project will help to predict the impacts of many competing factors on kidney health during diabetes management. The computer simulation produced in the project can also be used to test and optimize treatments to slow the progression of DKD. The project also will involve a set of educational activities related to the scientific work. Several undergraduate and graduate students including women and underrepresented minorities will work with the PI to conduct the research and educational activities. Educational modules related to the research will be delivered to a variety of groups including K-12 students, college students, and grandparents. Physical models of kidney tissues will be 3D-printed and shared with students and educators. The activities will expose many students and members of the public to biomedical engineering and computational science through engaging scientific demonstrations and interactive experiences.\n\nThe principal investigator's long-term career goal is to develop multiscale computational models to enhance understanding of the mechanisms governing tissue remodeling and damage as a result of diseases and infections and to simulate the treatment of those conditions to improve human health.  Toward this goal, this project will develop a novel computational approach for studying diabetic kidney disease (DKD) through a virtual kidney that can be used like a powerful, non-invasive microscope to look into the body to detect and monitor damage to the glomeruli (where most damage occurs) during the onset and progression of diabetic complications in the kidney. The virtual kidney platform will use multiscale computational modeling to connect effects at different length scales from smaller to larger: inside cells, between adjacent cells, across a single glomerulus, and among collections of glomeruli interacting with other tissues in a kidney. A hybrid computational approach will take advantage of the benefits of stochastic differential equations to describe chemical species that react and interact in large quantities and of agent-based models to describe cells and chemical species that interact in small quantities or in qualitative up- or down-regulation fashions.  The Research Plan is organized under two aims.  The FIRST AIM is to formulate cellular level mathematical models of biochemical cell signaling networks responsible for damage in each of the three main glomerular zones: a) podocytes, b) mesangial cells and mesangial matrix and c) endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane.  Computational tools will be developed for importing biochemical networks, conducting uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, and validating model results for the three zones.  To assess validity, computational models will be compared to experimental evidence gleaned from the literature. The SECOND AIM is to build a virtual kidney computational model focusing on crosstalk, structural, and hemodynamic effects on the primary tissue compartments within multiple nephrons.  Steps include:  a) constructing a hybrid computational model for tissue level simulation of glomerular cells that combines information from reactions in single cells, connects multiple interacting cells and transports glucose and other molecules through the mesangium and the glomerular filtration barrier; b) connecting the glomerular models to a tubule and vessel centric-model for blood flow and filtration regulation and c) validating the virtual kidney model and simulating responses to stimuli.  A user-friendly interface will be created for specifying model input and stimuli, running the simulations, and visualizing results.  Simulations of the virtual kidney model will be rigorously compared to pharmacological, physiological, and histological data, primarily from humans.  After model validation to a subset of the data cases, in silico experiments will be conducted to predict the magnitudes and rates of change for glomerular injury outcomes including proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under DKD pathophysiological conditions.  The metric for success will be the accurate simulation of the classic trajectory of onset and progression of DKD subject to clinically relevant input and stimuli.  Computational tools and code developed will be distributed openly via GitHub repositories, which may be of broad interest to the systems biology research community using SBML and/or CompuCell3D.  In summary, the project addresses the critical need to compile the multiple mechanistic processes that contribute to DKD onset and progression into a user-friendly systematic framework capable of taking the interconnected chemical, physical, and biological factors into account in a coupled fashion and in the appropriate magnitudes and sequences to make testable predictions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The researcher will develop a comparative study of three cities: Belfast, Melbourne, and Bombay. She will focus on the microbe, the colonial administrator, and the bacteriologist as the central actors in each of the three cases. She will do so by engaging in a study of archival documents and other sources to obtain a deeper understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that make each region unique. She plans to show how specific features of the local environment in these three regions, when combined with plans of sanitary improvement and land use change espoused by the British Empire, served to produce unique environments in which particular microbes thrived. The proposed project draws from multiple disciplinary sources and is intended for multiple disciplinary audiences. The researcher plans to disseminate her research results at conferences and workshops sponsored by history departments, epidemiology and public health departments, public health policy centers, and organizations that engage in climate studies.\n\nThis project uses a historical frame while engaging with a number of central topics in the field of science and technology studies. It engages with the concept of nonhuman agency with its focus on the ecological specificity of microbes, and it uses Niche Construction Theory to access the localized environments and to draw out their relationship to microbial actors. Cultural construction of science and technology, particularly as it relates to imperialism and nineteenth century colonial practices, will also be an important element of consideration to this project. Using relatively new social scientific frameworks to guide this history, this project will engage with STS in its goal to induce new consideration of the agency of living objects and actor-network theory as a viable historical and social scientific frame.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The strategy will be to study a demonstrated successful learning model that integrates traditional high school STEM curriculum with real world projects from the STEM business community. The study will illuminate how the components of the program work together to support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers, in particular female and minority students. The findings of the study will make it possible to implement the program in similar contexts across the nation. A better understanding of experiential learning within a public school district context can potentially impact tens of thousands of students. \n\nThe goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory case study of Blue Valley Center for Advanced Professional Studies (BVCAPS) which is the founding location of the Center for Advanced Professional Studies (CAPS) network. CAPS will provide programming that includes STEM capstone experiences (in medicine, bioscience, technology, or engineering) for public school high school juniors and seniors. Guided by the theoretical and conceptual constructs of social cognitive career theory and high-quality project-based learning, this study will seek to answer the following research questions: 1) How does the CAPS model support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers? 2) What aspects of the BVCAPS model contribute to increased female and under-represented minority student motivation and preparation for STEM careers? The qualitative exploration will be used to create a set of validated and reliable instruments that can be used to study this and similar programs more broadly as they relate to motivation and preparation for STEM careers. This study will build on the literature in high school STEM education in the area of project-based learning and capstone experiences in high school and add to the developing literature on high school STEM experiential learning. Measurement tools created by this study will enable examination of the capstone model in programs within the network of schools (over 10,000 students in more than 80 school districts within 13 states across the US) and more broadly. In addition to the potential impact of the measurement tools themselves, the findings of this study will address how other STEM educators can support the motivation and preparation for students in STEM careers, in particular female and minorities.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\n\nSRI International (SRI) in partnership with Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall) will conduct an efficacy study of a new comprehensive science curriculum for middle grades 6-8 called Amplify Science Middle School (ASMS). This school science curriculum integrates disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. The overarching aim of the study will be to understand the impact of the curriculum on student achievement, classroom implementation, and teacher practice in relation to the recommendations of \"A Framework for K-12 Science Education\" and the Next Generation of Science Standards. While the number of states fully adopting NGSS hovers at around 20, nearly another 20 states have either incorporated the Framework or substantial portions of the NGSS into their state frameworks. Currently, the number of curriculum materials that have been designed for the Framework are relatively few, and thus the efficacy evidence basis for NGSS-designed curricula is limited. As more and more curriculum materials become available for supporting the Framework vision, the science education field needs rigorous research on the efficacy of curricula and the conditions required to implement them. ASMS is the Hall's first comprehensive 6-8 grade curriculum that has been designed specifically to meet the vision of the Framework and NGSS. Field trials of ASMS with more than 475 teachers and 34,000 students in a wide variety of settings, including urban, rural and suburban schools, have shown positive impact on student achievement, providing a compelling reason for a large-scale efficacy trial at this time.\n\nThe study will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods within an experimental design that will allow the examination of relations between contextual factors and student learning gains to help explain the results. Thus, this study will be important for moving education researchers toward increased understanding of how to meaningfully study and support teaching and learning in districts that will be trying to implement the next generation of science curriculum materials. Work will be conducted in districts with large numbers of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields so that educators can better understand the promise of NGSS-aligned curricula in promoting access and equity in science education. The research team will conduct a random assignment efficacy study in 7th grade classrooms beginning in academic year 2018-19 and following up with these students as 8th graders in academic year 2019-20. Teachers in both conditions will receive professional development on the NGSS; teachers in the treatment condition will also receive professional development in the use of the ASMS materials. The recruiting target is a sample of 48 middle schools within up to 6 medium to large districts in California and/or Washington. The researchers will attempt to recruit all middle schools and all 7th grade\nscience teachers in a district. It is anticipated that each school will have an average of two teachers teaching 3 sections of 7th grade science with 30 students per section for an approximate total of 96 teachers and 8,640 students. All students should have opportunities to learn science. This study will aim to draw valid inferences about the impact of curricula in districts with high concentrations of students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. This work will also contribute to the larger, nationwide effort to support standards-based instructional reforms in science by helping to identify conditions needed for successful implementation of NGSS-designed curriculum materials. The findings will provide an important basis for investments in new curriculum materials and will be of strong interest to those in science education and the learning sciences, as well as to district leaders and policymakers concerned with scaling up of rigorous curriculum.",

Ordinarily, the term fraud is applied to illegal behavior. Globally, however, fraud allegations seem increasingly to provide a more general language to express extreme dissatisfaction with both instiutions and individuals for actions that range from the merely misleading to the truly unlawful. This research investigates why the use of the language of fraud has expanded, the political and social effects this entails, and how people re-build trust in the wake of perceived betrayals. The research is important because trust is necessary for healthy economies and robust democratic political systems. Research findings will therefore be of interest to both policy makers and citizens who seek to promote civic participation and economic development.\n\nThe research will be undertaken in the conjoined cities of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia. This site was chosen due to Bolivia's long history of donor-sponsored (including American-backed) rule-of-law reforms and concurrent projects encouraging entrepreneurship and the financial inclusion of the poor. Indeed, Bolivian fraud accusations frequently sit at the intersection of these two objectives: urging people to embrace entrepreneurship to lift themselves from poverty and ongoing efforts to stem economic crimes. The project builds on the researcher's decade-long fieldwork in Bolivia, allowing for longitudinal analyses and comparative data collection and the efficient use of funding. The researcher will gather data through a combination of qualitative research methods, including ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and archival research. Interviews will be conducted with regulatory officials, jurists, foreign donors, and NGO representatives to investigate the priority given to economic crimes and specifically fraud as an object of intervention. Archival data will provide insights into shifting regulations, historic pyramid scheme cases, and patterns in criminal cases related to fraud. Ethnographic research will focus on pyramid schemes and quasi-legal multilevel marketing companies. Findings from this research will illuminate the history, uses, and effects of fraud accusations and contribute to social science theory of fraud as a changing global category.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

STEM CareerLaunch integrates extant STEM programs, such as First Robotics, Girls Who Code and Jason Learning, with newly developed STEM content and opportunities to create and test a comprehensive STEM learning and career program for youth. The results of this pilot will inform a more expansive effort to bring STEM CareerLaunch to an already networked 4,000 Boys & Girls Clubs, reaching over four million youth from predominately underrepresented groups in STEM, and youth participating in other afterschool/summer program throughout the United States.\n\nApproximately 100 youth and informal educators in Boys & Girls Clubs in Fitchburg and Leominster, Massachusetts will participate in this pilot feasibility study. A five-pronged approach will be instituted including: (1) high quality out of school time STEM programming, (2) connected STEM career education, (3) mentorship, (4) professional development for the informal educators, and (5) incentives such as internships and field experiences for youth participants. The developmental evaluation will focus on program implementation, participant outcomes, and scale-up. Data collection methods will include quantitative and qualitative approaches such as baseline student data, project tracking logs, retrospective surveys, focus groups, staff interviews, and observations.  A summative evaluation will also be conducted.\n\nThis endeavor is led by a collaborative partnership between the National Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Worcester Polytechnic Institute STEM Center, the Fitchburg and Leominster Public School Districts, and others.

              "abstractText" : "The main goal of this project is to teach machines to understand human language when it contains spatial information. For example, to understand the statement, \"Give me the book on AI on the table to your left,\" a robot needs to understand that the first \"on\" expresses the topic of the book, while the second \"on\" and the rest of the sentence convey spatial information. Next, it needs to work out the visual meaning of \"on\" to identify the correct book. Spatial language understanding is challenging because it requires meaning disambiguation, recognizing the links between referenced objects, and in most cases, background knowledge and common sense. This is particularly true for more complex sentences that include nesting relations or idioms containing spatial terms, like \"she is the top expert in her field.\" The goal of this research is to develop techniques for the integration of machine learning and reasoning to advance spatial language comprehension. Solving this problem will provide tangible benefits to society in a wide variety of applications including healthcare (e.g., extracting biomedical information from patient reports and images), navigation and communication with assistant robots (particularly in risky situations like firefighter robots), situational awareness, information retrieval systems using various types of data, and geographical information systems.\n\nProviding reasoning capabilities to machine learning models is highly challenging. The proposed research advances this issue in an important and broad sub-problem: spatial language understanding. To this aim, a generic domain-independent symbolic spatial meaning representation will be introduced, which covers the main spatial semantic concepts for a variety of tasks. Deep structured and relational learning techniques will be developed to obtain such representations. The proposed techniques will facilitate indirect supervision by exploiting visual resources, will use ontologies that convey common sense and will integrate the axioms of spatial qualitative reasoning in training structured representations. Such an approach helps to avoid massive and complex data annotation for training structured and complex models. This research will evaluate whether using formal spatial calculi models as an intermediate structured representation will improve spatial reasoning and deeper learning. The interaction between learning and spatial reasoning will be investigated, while exploiting both symbolic and sub-symbolic representations. The impact of integrating explicit spatial reasoning will be tested on textual and visual question-answering tasks with a focus on locative questions. The outcome of this research will advance the generalizability of current state-of-the-art deep learning models at a time when there is a lack of training examples for complex unobserved situations. This work will help bridge the gap between symbolic AI and deep ML to advance spatial language understanding. The project will support research and education for graduate and undergraduate students and increase the contribution of women and minorities in STEM.\n\nThis award is jointly funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research in the Office of Integrative Activities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Much of science is found in peer-reviewed journals. However, researchers in the history or sociology of science cannot study what is accepted and what is rejected in these journals because until recently they did not have access to a body of data that included accepted and rejected manuscripts, the topics covered, the characteristics of those who submitted manuscripts, and the comments of the reviewers.  Moreover, they did not have such data over time, so that they might see changes within a discipline in terms of topics and submitters.  The American Sociological Association (ASA) has electronic copies of all the manuscripts and all the reviews for ASA journals for a twenty-year period between 1991 and 2010.  Based on a prior three-year, NSF-funded project, the Center for Social Science Research (CSSR) at the George Mason University has created a Digital Archive that contains this information for the American Sociological Review, the ASA top journal.   Given the complexities of the Archive data file, CSSR will hold a two-day workshop so that interested scholars can be trained to use it to answer critical questions about the history and development of sociology in a time-period of pronounced changes in the discipline.  Faculty trained on the use of the archive will pass on this knowledge to their colleagues in sociology and other disciplines to further the study of the peer-review system for a flagship journal. This project is beneficial because it allows for scrutiny of the scientific process.\n\nThis project will support a two-day workshop to be held in April 2019 to train faculty and graduate students in the use of the ASA/Mason American Sociological Review (ASR) Digital Archive.  The Center for Social Science Research (CSSR) at the George Mason University has created a Digital Archive of more than 8,000 manuscripts and 26,000 reviews. The Archive includes demographic and institutional information of authors and reviews over a 20-year time-span.  The Archive was created by examining all submitted manuscripts, matching them with reviewers, and using the internet to secure other information about authors and reviewers. This information was merged into four types of files, including author, reviewer, person, and manuscript information. Workshop participants will become familiar with the files and learn how to link them and/or how to use each separately, depending on the research question to be answered. Examining these files allows researchers to determine whether the peer networks of reviews are intellectually distant from those of authors, or whether both the author and the reviewer are in the same networks, thus suggesting the potential for reviewer bias.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The phenomenon of language shift, in which a community ceases to speak their heritage language in favor of another (typically more socially and economically prestigious) language, has long been of interest to linguists and anthropologists. For immigrants to the United States and other countries, it is an often-repeated \"rule\" that language shift typically occurs by the third generation (i.e., the grandchildren of the original immigrants). This project, which trains a student in rigorous, empirically-grounded methods of data collection and analysis in cultural and linguistic anthropology, asks what factors might contribute to influence language shift among an earlier generational cohort. Additionally, the researcher explores whether there are grammatical, phonological or other patterns that can be identified in first-generation language shift, and how speakers navigate overlapping identities in the new cultural context. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in linguistics and anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to improve public understanding of indigeneity, language shift, and multilingualism. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and contributes to the education of underrepresented groups. \n\nUnder the supervision of Dr. Mary Bucholtz at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Anna Bax will work with a selected cohort of Mixtec women who grew up in Ventura County, California to understand how they variably use Spanish, English, and Mixtec for identity construction purposes. In Ventura County, the majority of the indigenous immigrant community is of Mixtec heritage and speak Mixtec languages, which are native to southern Mexico and differ radically from Spanish. This linguistic and anthropological project explores the question of how young women in this diasporic community, who may face gendered expectations to maintain their heritage language and culture, navigate the accelerated process of first-generation language shift. It seeks to address the following research questions: (1) How is Mixtec identity linguistically constructed, even as many community members are losing the ability to speak Mixtec entirely? How can Spanish and English linguistic resources come to symbolize Mixtec identity in the wake of this loss? (2) What strategies do individual participants use to navigate community language shift, and how do they balance their overlapping identities as indigenous Mexicans and as new members of American society? The researcher will take a case-study approach, using linguistic-anthropological and sociophonetic methods to explore how these young women maintain strong links to their indigenous identity, even as some of them have lost the ability to speak their heritage language. Participant-observation and ethnographic interviews will be conducted with this focal set of youth, as well as with key members of their social networks. In order to collect rich, detailed data about the participants' varying linguistic repertoires, they will also audio-record their own speech practices in naturalistic interaction in different social settings, so as to document shifts in their use of the focal linguistic variables and their performances of indigenous identity. The researcher will conduct a quantitative sociophonetic analysis of one Spanish and one English linguistic variable, with a focus on the connections of these variables to indigenous identity and how the use of the variables differs across social contexts. The participants' speech will also be compared to a corpus of local Chicanas' speech to understand the social construction of linguistic difference and/or similarity. Qualitative discourse-analytic methods will be used to understand the social meanings attached to these variables, as well as the meaning of participants' Mixtec code-switching practices. The results of this research will benefit local community centers who are invested in the maintenance of indigenous languages, and will be used to inform local public and educational policymaking about linguistic diversity. In addition, the project directly benefits the young indigenous participants, most of whom are current college students, by centrally involving them in STEM research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Cohort-building activities will include an academic boot camp before the students' first college semester, and courses taken by all cohort members. The project will provide a monthly seminar series on topics such as internships, industry mentoring, undergraduate research, and international exchange programs. The project's activities have been positively linked to academic success. This project aims to achieve broader impact by contributing to state and federal strategic workforce diversification goals. Project activities that support these goals include engineering outreach programs and courses on engineering design for K-12 educators. It is expected that the project will generate new knowledge about how engineering education can be improved to better serve the growing number of lower-income, academically talented students entering college.

              "abstractText" : "Research shows that companies with greater representation of women in leadership positions perform better than those with lower percentages of women in the upper echelons of the organization. In order to encourage female leaders, many companies leverage diversity training initiatives or women-centered solutions, such as women's networking groups or leadership training. While these solutions have merits, they often place the burden of creating more gender inclusive organizations on women themselves. A more effective approach to enhance gender inclusivity is to understand the role that male leaders may play in supporting women's advancement within organizations. While many male leaders may understand the importance of supporting female leaders, they may not know how to effectively do so. This proposal seeks to identify effective behaviors of male champions for female leadership and for supporting gender equality in organizations. This research highlights ways in which males can contribute to gender inclusivity at work. Results from this project can inform organizations about how to influence, train, and encourage possible male champions to actively support female leadership in the workplace. \n\nMale champions, or male leaders who value diversity in the workplace and support advancing talented females to leader positions, have a critical role to play as agents of change to enhance gender equality. The purpose of this project is to identify the effective behaviors of male champions. Multiple studies that utilize different research designs and methods will be conducted to examine these behaviors. First, we will conduct a qualitative study, which utilizes interviews with male champions and those who have been supported by male champions, to determine key gender inclusive leadership behaviors. Themes derived from the interviews will be used to generate a quantitative measure of gender inclusive behaviors among male leaders. Second, we will conduct a quantitative study to examine the relationship between gender inclusive leader behaviors and workplace outcomes. Effects of top-level leaders' gender inclusive behaviors on their direct reports attitudes and performance will be examined using multi-source, multi-level data. Finally, we will conduct an in-depth case study of a best practices company for gender inclusive leadership. This study will utilize observational data and in-depth interviews with high level leaders and their direct reports to better understand the processes through which male champion behaviors create gender inclusive workplace cultures. Results of this research can benefit workers and their organizations by enhancing our understanding of factors contributing to gender equality in organizations.",

              "abstractText" : "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to enhance listening comprehension skills via an innovative interactive learning platform that aligns with Common Core State Standards for listening comprehension and uses best practices in game-based learning. In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.\n\nThis project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "All languages have words to indicate entities that are being referred to. These words (e.g. this and that), known in linguistics as demonstratives, are typically used to focus the hearer's attention on entities in the speech situation. Over time, some of these words evolve and may develop various kinds of new functions such as connectives and hesitation signals. Despite the universality of demonstratives across languages, demonstratives differ in how they change and why they evolve in certain ways. Although demonstratives have long been a key research topic in linguistics, we know surprisingly little about how demonstratives and demonstrative-derived pragmatic markers are used in spontaneous face-to-face conversation. This is due to the fact that the most commonly used genres in linguistic analysis are written discourse and oral narratives rather than spoken discourse. The results and transcriptions will help applied linguists and L2 educators develop more effective materials for teaching Mandarin Chinese, a critical language designated by the U.S. government. The project database will enhance the infrastructure for language-related research and education, and will contribute to the training of students.  \n\nThis dissertation project recognizes the methodological limitations in previous text-based analyses and investigates how the distal demonstrative na 'that' is used in Mandarin Chinese everyday conversation from a discourse-pragmatic perspective. Apart from its canonical usage as a distal demonstrative, na has various kinds of extended and nuanced discourse functions. This project sets out to identify and classify different uses of na, with a special focus on its previously overlooked non-referential discourse pragmatic functions. More specifically, it will uncover sequential contexts, functional accounts, and positions of na using both a quantitative approach and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to offer a systematic analysis that accounts for all the occurrences and functions of na by speakers in actual everyday conversation. The secondary goal is to shed light on a better understanding of robust similarities and subtle language specific variations in the grammaticalization and/or pragmaticalization of demonstratives, particularly the non-deictic uses of pragmatic markers derived from demonstratives. This dissertation project will contribute to a deeper understanding of a common human language phenomenon with fresh data and from an interactional perspective.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project will capture data and knowledge from the last generation of Tanana and Gwich'in Athabascan elders who were raised in tribal communities largely untouched by Western colonization.  This generation, now in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, are taking key knowledge and data sets with them as they die, leaving subsequent generations impacted by this loss of knowledge. \n\nThe project will document Indigenous Knowledge of resilience through a qualitative phenomenology framework in using semi-structured interviews conducted by community researchers with Indigenous elders of the Central and Upper Yukon Basin, born between the years 1920 and 1950. Primary research questions are:\n-\tHow have adaptation strategies changed over a lifetime?\n-\tHow did environmental changes trigger changes in community social structure?\n-\tWhat lessons about resilience can be learned from the generation that bridged the gap between largely traditional Athabascan lifestyle and Anglo-European colonization?\nInterviews will be conducted with up to six Elders from the central Yukon Athabascan region - a remote area that was one of the last areas in Alaska to experience colonization. This project is urgent as the Elders who are the subjects of this research project are near end of life with three of the original Elders identified for this project having passed away during the previous two years. Additionally, a rural, Alaskan Native person will be trained in the project methodology and taught to harness the tools of science in the preservation of culture. Products include a plain language report that will be geared toward Native Alaskans, and the collected information and data will be made available via a public repository for other Native Alaskans and scientific researchers.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The damage from this tornado was concentrated in older low-income neighborhoods with many uninsured houses, limited government assistance, and low capacity to provide replacement housing within the community. This research examines recovery needs resulting from social vulnerability especially tenure and immigration. The results will assist planners, emergency managers, and policymakers to incorporate approaches within recovery programs that better communicate assistance eligibility criteria with immigrants. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to assist recovery of our most vulnerable populations after a disaster.\n\nThis research addresses gaps in the disaster literature with respect to low attention disasters that affect immigrants, renters and contract homeowners. Vulnerable households like immigrants and non-homeowners are at a disadvantage for accessing recovery assistance to complete home repairs and subsequently at a higher risk of long-term displacement. This project collects data to examine recovery experiences of immigrants and non-homeowners in the aftermath of the Marshalltown tornado that did not receive much attention and resources despite causing major damages in low income neighborhoods with a relatively higher percentage of minority, immigrant, and non-homeowner households. Hence, it offers a unique possibility for assessing the complex recovery challenges related to housing tenure and immigration after low attention disasters. Methods of data collection consist of conducting focus groups with households, one on one interviews, and participant observation. Analysis methods include qualitative coding of data through theme identification and constant comparison.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Short-term environmental disturbances and long-term environmental change have displaced millions worldwide. The US Gulf Coast region is especially vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes, sea level rise, land subsidence, and flooding. Some parishes in Louisiana have lost over 90% of their land, largely due to environmental changes. What socioeconomic and cultural factors influence perceptions of environment risk and migration? This project investigates factors not traditionally associated with the environment, including ties to place, strong social relationships, and counter perceptions of environmental risk, that might keep people in place, despite environmental risk. Migration theory suggests that behavior is largely linked to economic factors, such as income opportunities or life ambitions. This research, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, will investigate whether, and to what extent, environmental perceptions impact movement decisions. Improved understanding of movement decisions can inform local and state decision makers, yielding more precise composite descriptions of their constituents and likely behavioral outcomes, enabling better prediction of migration patterns and strategic planning. Environmental perceptions are also of value to the emergency and first-response communities when they confront new environmental dangers. The ability to better communicate environmental risk or danger can ultimately help to save lives.\n\nCharlotte Till, under the supervision of Dr. Shauna BurnSilver of Arizona State University, will explore the relationship between risk perceptions and migration decisions. This research will be conducted in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, an ideal setting for studying risk where there are both acute and chronic stressors on movement behavior. Hurricanes pose a severe seasonal threat to this area, but sea level rise and land subsidence represent cumulative risks and a new everyday reality for coastal people. During pilot study work in the area in 2016 the researchers found that relative to younger residents, older residents had less intention to leave despite known risks, and factors such as home, family, or community were important features of the environment. Based on survey and interview methodologies this research will first identify how the environment is perceived, and then investigate the influence of these perceptions on movement decisions. Survey responses will form the baseline data representing local perceptions, and then a subset of respondents will be invited to interviews allowing the investigator to explore movement logic(s) and the significance of identified influence factors for their decision making. Text analysis tools will be used to analyze interview data. Examples of the insights possible through the findings of this work include: how movement decisions are made, what factors result in place attachment outweighing risk, and how environmental factors interact with movement decisions. By actively incorporating individuals who do not move, this project is targeting an understudied but critical group for analyzing human movement patterns. By drawing participants directly from the parish this research may spur greater public engagement with science, contributing toward greater public scientific literacy. This research contributes to development of the migration literature on the role of the environment in movement decisions and factors impacting those decisions. This project will also facilitate improved understanding and engagement among communities, emergency managers, and municipal respresentatives.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make walking both safer and easier for transfemoral amputees. Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable economic development aid organizations to plan, implement, measure, and achieve better gender equality and social inclusion outcomes. Gender equality is recognized as an important factor in catalyzing development and lifting communities out of poverty. Empowered women contribute to healthy and productive families, communities, and nations. An important step in doing this is to integrate high quality and timely gender analysis (examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and opportunities affect men, women, girls and boys in specific contexts), into decision-making and project planning. For both public and private sectors, early, action-oriented gender analysis is vital to tackle improve outcomes. In 2015 - 2016, OECD aid agencies spent, on average, $41.7 billion per year targeting gender equality and women's empowerment. Conservatively estimating that 3-5% of this expenditure is for gender analysis and action planning, that makes a market of $1.3-2.1 billion in the development sector alone. This project can potentially improve outcomes from that development funding.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a web-based application that automates the currently manual process of conducting gender analyses. This addresses a real world challenge faced by aid organizations to effectively integrate gender analyses into planning to inform effective and timely decision-making. Despite being a requirement by many organizations, there are procurement and contract delays, shortage of gender experts, and manual research and data collection.  This project will develop a machine learning model that leverages big data, APIs, and text-mining, driven by an analytic framework created by experts, to automate this process and deliver customized results instantly for a fraction of the cost. Phase I will build, train, and test the model for one sector and select countries. By the end of Phase I, the model will be tested and iterated to meet high quality control standards. Once validated, it will be ready to scale globally across sectors.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "There has arguably never been a more exciting time to be an engineer. In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.\n\nA two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment. Finally, the workshop will catalyze new research collaborations, projects, and funding proposals related to engineering practice. Workshop activities will incorporate discussions of missing voices and contexts in the literature to identify critical areas for future research that supports broadening participation. Anticipated outcomes include an editorial or position piece on the current state of research on engineering education and actionable guidelines for future research, an edited volume or special issue of a journal comprised of papers or commentaries on engineering education and practice, and a workshop summary report. A special session during the 2018 FIE conference is also planned, to share highlights from the workshop, provide preliminary guidance on methods and approaches for research on engineering practice, and further grow the community of interest among a larger number of potential participants.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "This SBIR Phase I project will produce a digital + physical game for 6-10 year olds that fosters computational thinking practices through collaboration, listening, and tinkering through play with music. It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.\n\n\nThe core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Advances in transportation systems, fueled by on-demand mobility-platforms, crowd-sourcing, ride-hailing and increasing automation, promise to enhance the livability and competitiveness of cities and rural areas globally. A fundamental question is whether these innovations will contribute to solving, or inadvertently exacerbate, critical challenges such as congestion, emissions and inequitable access to mobility. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) research addresses a gap in current approaches by integrating quantitative and qualitative multi-disciplinary insights and developing methods to study how society adapts to evolving mobility technologies. Integrating insights from the social sciences in existing passenger and logistics system models will help understand how adoption behaviors are affected by diverse community beliefs and culture in rapidly changing mobility contexts. This research will have far-reaching effects, delivering new tools to tailor transformative mobility solutions to citizens' needs, decongest urban networks and expand mobility to underserved communities. The project includes educational efforts where students evaluate engineering solutions that align with human behavior and livability goals. The project will also develop online educational material and training tools for Chicago high school teachers, to promote careers in engineering in diverse communities. \n\nThe goal of this project is to establish a new foundation and develop methods to better understand and predict impacts of emerging freight and passenger mobility adoption. Specifically, this research establishes an analytical community mobility adoption framework that integrates current quantitative theory, data and methods (i.e. formal surveys, discrete choice analysis and supervised learning) with qualitative social science perspectives (theory of social thresholds, ethnographic data on neighborhood-scale mobility behavior). Robust policy guidance tools derived through combining qualitative, participatory, multi-stakeholder research methods and formal policy scenario simulation are expected to inform communities' transition resulting from the potentially disruptive socio-technical changes in transportation mobility choices. The impact will be strengthened by integration with education and outreach approaches that inspire, challenge and educate future civil engineers to address mobility challenges with technically informed and culturally sensitive designs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Training engineering faculty in engineering education research expands the number of faculty adopting research-based instructional practices in their courses, and results in improved teaching, advising, programming, and policy-making by closing the research-to-practice gap.\n\nWhile previous mentorship models have focused on the content of engineering education as a field, this work identifies effective strategies from successful mentoring relationships that incorporate the social and cultural components of becoming an engineering education researcher. By conducting qualitative interviews of engineering faculty and engineering education researchers mentee-mentor pairs, the study the study develops a conceptual model of the formation of engineering education researchers' identity.

              "abstractText" : "Criminal courts that operate under the same formal law and policy often develop their own norms and practices, resulting in very different kinds of justice outcomes depending upon where a case is adjudicated. And when formal legal policies change, the reforms generally get implemented in distinct and divergent ways by local court actors, sometimes in ways inconsistent with policy goals. This project capitalizes upon recent major policy changes imposed in the federal criminal system by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to examine how different court \"communities\" have responded to the changes. Specifically, new policies have been developed urging prosecutors to focus on certain kinds of federal crimes, and that require prosecutors across the country to maximize the potential punishment. While the DOJ policies aim for standardized prosecutorial practices across the diverse federal district courts, prior research suggests that local courts will vary in how they translate these directives into action.  \n \nThe study builds directly upon the PI's previous NSF-funded research that examined jurisdictional differences in adjudication strategies in federal court, using both qualitative field methods and quantitative methods. The project revisits the same research sites (4 geographically and demographically diverse federal districts) to assess whether and how the current DOJ policy impacts caseload characteristics (including defendant demography) and adjudication practices and outcomes, with a focus on how formal top-down policy is translated into localized, on-the-ground legal action. Using interviews, observations, and administrative data from the federal courts, the project tests three related hypotheses: 1) Despite the return to policies that aim to control local practices through top-down mandates, adaptations will be localized in practice. Between-district variations will continue to be evident in four distinct sets of practices: case selection; prosecutorial charging practices; terms and modes of plea agreements; and formal sentencing practices. 2) Within-district, demographic composition of the caseload, the application of prosecutorial-controlled sentencing tools, and sentence lengths will change as a function of temporal period, but local adjudication norms will temper such change. 3) The degree of change in local practice norms will be greater in the current policy period (beginning May, 2017) than the previous one (2010-2017) because the current policy authorizes increased punishment for defendants and includes local compliance mechanisms.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite these frequent attributions, there is scant empirical evidence about how people view the role of luck in their lives, and how these views vary across the population. This proposal will analyze how people define luck, their views about the influence of luck on individual outcomes, and the aspects of their lives, e.g., financial success, job status, health, personal relationships, to which they apply luck. A critical component of the research will evaluate the extent to which people attribute socioeconomic outcomes to luck as compared with individual talents and effort. A better understanding of these perceptions will shed new light on views about social inequality, the factors that lead to success and failure, and individual motivations. These findings will provide new information to help individuals in society reflect upon the relative roles of luck, talent, and effort as reasons for their own outcomes as well as the outcomes for others in society.    \n \n \nThis proposal will conduct in-depth, open-ended interviews with a broadly representative national sample of 100 U.S. adults. Data will include age, socioeconomic status, race, military experience, health history, political affiliation, and gender. Data analysis will be conducted using ATLAS.ti. Following the general principles of grounded theory and abductive analysis, all interviews will be coded for primary patterns of response identifying general themes and key variations among participant groups.

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship provides an emerging scholar-scientist with an opportunity to investigate the ways in which diverse Black families navigate the racial socialization of their youth in the 21st century. The well-being of Black children in the United States is a matter of grave public health significance. The unfortunate realities of Ferguson, MI, Baltimore, MD, Sanford, FL, Charleston, SC, McKinney, TX, Cleveland, OH, and Chicago, IL, have left many in our society with questions about how to provide youth with the triumvirate \"affection, protection, and correction\"  required to optimize their psychosocial wellbeing. Racial socialization (RS) is a process that has been associated with a number of positive outcomes. However, this research has largely assessed Black mothers (of mother-father households), has predominately used survey data, and has focused on retrospective reporting of RS, limiting our conceptual understanding of a crucial parenting practice. This project addresses these limitations, expanding the study of RS in a number of important ways.\n\nThe project, entitled the \"Black Family Racial Socialization Project\" focuses on the development of three studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods, from the perspective of both parents and youth. The primary aim of the first study is to use survey and interview methods to elucidate the ways in which Black families representing a diverse structural spectrum (e.g., extended kin, blended families, LGBT couples) prepare themselves to undertake the RS of their children. The primary aim of the second study is to capture the synergistic and bidirectional nature of RS \"in the moment\", by using media (e.g., TV scenes, song lyrics, social media posts) to create and code ecologically-valid, family-level racial socialization conversations. The primary aim of the third study is to prospectively assess how Black parents and Black parents-to-be anticipate teaching their children about race \"in the future\". This study will utilize annual interviews and biannual surveys to monitor how intentions to socialize Black youth (and actual socialization behaviors) change over time, and to elucidate the principal factors that instigate such changes. Together, this research will lead to the development of a more complete conceptual framework that can be tested and instituted in future investigations. In addition, the findings from this research are expected to contribute to the development of effective interventions for Black families.",

              "abstractText" : "With Big Data comes the need for succinct data summaries that are easy to visualize and understand. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a particular suite of computational tools for summarizing and visualizing shape in high-dimensional data sets. These tools have been used in recent years to guide new discoveries in cancer research, neuroscience, materials science, image analysis, and many areas where shape, broadly construed, is of importance. However, by summarizing data in a succinct way certain important differences between data sets can often go undetected. This project provides a new mathematical framework for precisely measuring how lossy the most popular methods in TDA are. By developing new ways for quantifying how large-scale differences go undetected, the project offers enrichments of current topological methods to obtain novel data science tools with greater distinguishing power. The awarded funds will go primarily to fund a graduate student to aid the PI in basic research and development of these enriched topological summaries. Computational experiments on data sets of public interest, e.g. time-varying socio-economic indicators and weather data, will be carried out to test performance of these tools against current state of the art methods. Additionally, the PI will incorporate these novel methods into the data science curriculum at the PI's host institution and recruit students from historically under-represented groups to be trained as the nation's next generation of data scientists.\n\nThis project is an ambitious extension of earlier work undertaken by the PI and provides a targeted attack on the inverse problem for the main objects of study in topological data analysis: the merge tree, which tracks how connected components of the sub-level set of a function evolves; Reeb graphs, which tracks connected components of the fiber of a function; and the barcode/persistence diagram, which is a collection of intervals/points in the plane that represent an algorithmic pairing of critical points of a function on a space. The PI showed in earlier work how merge trees determine the associated barcode and provided a precise enumeration of how many distinct merge trees have the same barcode. By identifying functions on the real line that are related by an orientation preserving coordinate transformation, the PI showed how a novel enrichment of the merge tree---the chiral merge tree---faithfully captures these equivalence classes of functions and offers exponential distinguishing power over the barcode for time-series analysis. This project aims to carry out similar analysis for functions on surfaces, with an eye toward improving the classification performance of persistent homology in image analysis, and for Reeb graphs, to better integrate with level-set persistent homology. By carrying out a careful study of inverse problems in each of these settings, novel enrichments analogous to the chiral merge tree will be developed. Additionally, to make these enriched topological summaries useful for data classification tasks, novel metrics will be defined for comparing each of these summaries and algorithms will be developed for the efficient computation of these metrics.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

International development groups refer to these as \"child marriages\" and consider them to be damaging to well-being, particularly for girls. Therefore, with wide support from Western nations, including the United States, significant resources are invested in campaigns to eradicate these practices. However, this movement has also been critiqued for relying on a notion that there is a clear and absolute boundary between childhood and adulthood that lies at 18 years. In fact, there is surprisingly little objective information available about why \"child marriage\" remains prevalent in some places despite its purported harmful consequences. The research supported by this award will address this question. Results from the project will support policy recommendations, and contribute to a wider critical engagement with the notion that early transitions to adulthood are necessarily harmful in all circumstances. \n\nResearch will be carried out in north western Tanzania among a Sukuma population where around one-third of girls marry before 18 years. Data collection will take place within a demographic surveillance site managed by the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research. Taking a mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected over a two-year period. To build an understanding of early marriage grounded in ethnographic reality, rather than stereotype, the project will first utilize focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify perceived risks to wellbeing that characterize female adolescence and the role of early marriage in elevating or mitigating such risk. Multiple dimensions of female wellbeing (physical and mental health, education, food security, empowerment, and community respect) will then be assessed via a large quantitative survey, and analyzed to determine if 18 years emerges as a meaningful threshold demarcating harmful marriage, or whether alternative age categorizations, if any, better predict variation in wellbeing. Quantitative and qualitative data will then be used test the hypotheses that early marriage is either the product of parental coercion and a parent-offspring conflict of interests, or whether it is better understood as a parental strategy to enhance the success of daughters. Finally, the project will quantify associations between age at menarche, first reproduction and marriage to explore hypothesized links between physiological and behavioral transitions into adulthood. The project includes the mentorship of an American Postdoctoral Scholar, research experience opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and capacity building for longer-term international collaborative research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Long range HF communications allow wireless communication over thousands of kilometers without the need for satellites, and are of immeasurable importance to military and government, aviation, air-to-ground communications, maritime services, public safety and civil service distress communications, space and satellite operations, weather stations, FM and TV broad casting, and many other communication needs. This REU site will provide participating students a high quality, immersive, and hands-on learning experience in this exciting area. Participants will receive coaching to prepare for graduate school and professional development, and they will be mentored into becoming independent creative thinkers and researchers. Participants will gain experience in scientific dissemination and communication, including publishing in professional conferences and journals, and giving scientific presentations.\n\nLong range HF communications work by the reflection of radio waves by the ionosphere layer of the atmosphere. These communications can travel around curvature of the earth, and work without the need for significant infrastructure like satellites, cellular networks, internet, etc. The challenge with HF communications is that propagation via the ionosphere may be unreliable, the ionospheric conditions may change very rapidly, and different frequencies have different propagation characteristics via the ionosphere. Successful communication depends on the time of day, location of users, selection of frequency, modulation, antenna type, and power level.  This project will generate new solutions to key problems that will enable more dependable and efficient long range HF communications. Specifically this project will investigate and develop: (i) New designs for spectrum agile radios for high frequency communications that can switch communication parameters such as modulation, coding, pulse shape, equalizer, power, etc.; (ii) Machine learning algorithms that can learn the best communication parameters for changing channel conditions; (iii) Low profile antennas that can be used in HF communications; (iv) Software and algorithms to predict network level connections that are possible ahead of time; (v) Qualitative and quantitative Ionospheric communications models; (vi) Flexible and automatic antenna tuning circuits; and (vii) Smart algorithms that can learn from their past experiences in varying Ionospheric conditions, weather situations, time and location.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a serious complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is the leading cause of kidney failure. Yet, it is still not clear how the many underlying chemical, physical, and biological processes interact to damage the kidneys during diabetes. It is challenging to monitor the damage to the kidneys inside a patient. The regions of the kidney that are damaged are very small and are deep within the body. It takes a long time for irreversible damage to accumulate to the point where non-invasive urine samples contain detectable quantities of proteins that leaked through the kidneys. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will connect several processes that have been shown individually to contribute to injury in kidneys due to diabetes into a sophisticated computer simulation. This computational tool will aid in understanding how the processes interact and how diabetic kidney damage begins and changes over time. In the long-term, results from this project will help to predict the impacts of many competing factors on kidney health during diabetes management. The computer simulation produced in the project can also be used to test and optimize treatments to slow the progression of DKD. The project also will involve a set of educational activities related to the scientific work. Several undergraduate and graduate students including women and underrepresented minorities will work with the PI to conduct the research and educational activities. Educational modules related to the research will be delivered to a variety of groups including K-12 students, college students, and grandparents. Physical models of kidney tissues will be 3D-printed and shared with students and educators. The activities will expose many students and members of the public to biomedical engineering and computational science through engaging scientific demonstrations and interactive experiences.\n\nThe principal investigator's long-term career goal is to develop multiscale computational models to enhance understanding of the mechanisms governing tissue remodeling and damage as a result of diseases and infections and to simulate the treatment of those conditions to improve human health.  Toward this goal, this project will develop a novel computational approach for studying diabetic kidney disease (DKD) through a virtual kidney that can be used like a powerful, non-invasive microscope to look into the body to detect and monitor damage to the glomeruli (where most damage occurs) during the onset and progression of diabetic complications in the kidney. The virtual kidney platform will use multiscale computational modeling to connect effects at different length scales from smaller to larger: inside cells, between adjacent cells, across a single glomerulus, and among collections of glomeruli interacting with other tissues in a kidney. A hybrid computational approach will take advantage of the benefits of stochastic differential equations to describe chemical species that react and interact in large quantities and of agent-based models to describe cells and chemical species that interact in small quantities or in qualitative up- or down-regulation fashions.  The Research Plan is organized under two aims.  The FIRST AIM is to formulate cellular level mathematical models of biochemical cell signaling networks responsible for damage in each of the three main glomerular zones: a) podocytes, b) mesangial cells and mesangial matrix and c) endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane.  Computational tools will be developed for importing biochemical networks, conducting uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, and validating model results for the three zones.  To assess validity, computational models will be compared to experimental evidence gleaned from the literature. The SECOND AIM is to build a virtual kidney computational model focusing on crosstalk, structural, and hemodynamic effects on the primary tissue compartments within multiple nephrons.  Steps include:  a) constructing a hybrid computational model for tissue level simulation of glomerular cells that combines information from reactions in single cells, connects multiple interacting cells and transports glucose and other molecules through the mesangium and the glomerular filtration barrier; b) connecting the glomerular models to a tubule and vessel centric-model for blood flow and filtration regulation and c) validating the virtual kidney model and simulating responses to stimuli.  A user-friendly interface will be created for specifying model input and stimuli, running the simulations, and visualizing results.  Simulations of the virtual kidney model will be rigorously compared to pharmacological, physiological, and histological data, primarily from humans.  After model validation to a subset of the data cases, in silico experiments will be conducted to predict the magnitudes and rates of change for glomerular injury outcomes including proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under DKD pathophysiological conditions.  The metric for success will be the accurate simulation of the classic trajectory of onset and progression of DKD subject to clinically relevant input and stimuli.  Computational tools and code developed will be distributed openly via GitHub repositories, which may be of broad interest to the systems biology research community using SBML and/or CompuCell3D.  In summary, the project addresses the critical need to compile the multiple mechanistic processes that contribute to DKD onset and progression into a user-friendly systematic framework capable of taking the interconnected chemical, physical, and biological factors into account in a coupled fashion and in the appropriate magnitudes and sequences to make testable predictions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

She will do so by engaging in a study of archival documents and other sources to obtain a deeper understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that make each region unique. She plans to show how specific features of the local environment in these three regions, when combined with plans of sanitary improvement and land use change espoused by the British Empire, served to produce unique environments in which particular microbes thrived.

The researcher plans to disseminate her research results at conferences and workshops sponsored by history departments, epidemiology and public health departments, public health policy centers, and organizations that engage in climate studies.\n\nThis project uses a historical frame while engaging with a number of central topics in the field of science and technology studies. It engages with the concept of nonhuman agency with its focus on the ecological specificity of microbes, and it uses Niche Construction Theory to access the localized environments and to draw out their relationship to microbial actors. Cultural construction of science and technology, particularly as it relates to imperialism and nineteenth century colonial practices, will also be an important element of consideration to this project.

The study will illuminate how the components of the program work together to support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers, in particular female and minority students. The findings of the study will make it possible to implement the program in similar contexts across the nation. A better understanding of experiential learning within a public school district context can potentially impact tens of thousands of students. \n\nThe goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory case study of Blue Valley Center for Advanced Professional Studies (BVCAPS) which is the founding location of the Center for Advanced Professional Studies (CAPS) network. CAPS will provide programming that includes STEM capstone experiences (in medicine, bioscience, technology, or engineering) for public school high school juniors and seniors. Guided by the theoretical and conceptual constructs of social cognitive career theory and high-quality project-based learning, this study will seek to answer the following research questions: 1) How does the CAPS model support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers? 2) What aspects of the BVCAPS model contribute to increased female and under-represented minority student motivation and preparation for STEM careers? The qualitative exploration will be used to create a set of validated and reliable instruments that can be used to study this and similar programs more broadly as they relate to motivation and preparation for STEM careers. This study will build on the literature in high school STEM education in the area of project-based learning and capstone experiences in high school and add to the developing literature on high school STEM experiential learning. Measurement tools created by this study will enable examination of the capstone model in programs within the network of schools (over 10,000 students in more than 80 school districts within 13 states across the US) and more broadly. In addition to the potential impact of the measurement tools themselves, the findings of this study will address how other STEM educators can support the motivation and preparation for students in STEM careers, in particular female and minorities.

Using a collective impact approach, the STEM CareerLaunch pilot project tests the feasibility of redesigning a widely used, national youth and career focused program for and by the National Boys & Girls Clubs of America to extend STEM learning and promote awareness, interest, and readiness for STEM-related occupations among youth. STEM CareerLaunch integrates extant STEM programs, such as First Robotics, Girls Who Code and Jason Learning, with newly developed STEM content and opportunities to create and test a comprehensive STEM learning and career program for youth. The results of this pilot will inform a more expansive effort to bring STEM CareerLaunch to an already networked 4,000 Boys & Girls Clubs, reaching over four million youth from predominately underrepresented groups in STEM, and youth participating in other afterschool/summer program throughout the United States.\n\nApproximately 100 youth and informal educators in Boys & Girls Clubs in Fitchburg and Leominster, Massachusetts will participate in this pilot feasibility study. A five-pronged approach will be instituted including: (1) high quality out of school time STEM programming, (2) connected STEM career education, (3) mentorship, (4) professional development for the informal educators, and (5) incentives such as internships and field experiences for youth participants. The developmental evaluation will focus on program implementation, participant outcomes, and scale-up. Data collection methods will include quantitative and qualitative approaches such as baseline student data, project tracking logs, retrospective surveys, focus groups, staff interviews, and observations.  A summative evaluation will also be conducted.\n\nThis endeavor is led by a collaborative partnership between the National Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Worcester Polytechnic Institute STEM Center, the Fitchburg and Leominster Public School Districts, and others. It is primarily funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. It is also co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program which is committed to better understanding and promoting practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, and or mathematics (STEM).\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, researchers in the history or sociology of science cannot study what is accepted and what is rejected in these journals because until recently they did not have access to a body of data that included accepted and rejected manuscripts, the topics covered, the characteristics of those who submitted manuscripts, and the comments of the reviewers.  Moreover, they did not have such data over time, so that they might see changes within a discipline in terms of topics and submitters.  The American Sociological Association (ASA) has electronic copies of all the manuscripts and all the reviews for ASA journals for a twenty-year period between 1991 and 2010.  Based on a prior three-year, NSF-funded project, the Center for Social Science Research (CSSR) at the George Mason University has created a Digital Archive that contains this information for the American Sociological Review, the ASA top journal.   Given the complexities of the Archive data file, CSSR will hold a two-day workshop so that interested scholars can be trained to use it to answer critical questions about the history and development of sociology in a time-period of pronounced changes in the discipline.  Faculty trained on the use of the archive will pass on this knowledge to their colleagues in sociology and other disciplines to further the study of the peer-review system for a flagship journal. This project is beneficial because it allows for scrutiny of the scientific process.\n\nThis project will support a two-day workshop to be held in April 2019 to train faculty and graduate students in the use of the ASA/Mason American Sociological Review (ASR) Digital Archive.  The Center for Social Science Research (CSSR) at the George Mason University has created a Digital Archive of more than 8,000 manuscripts and 26,000 reviews. The Archive includes demographic and institutional information of authors and reviews over a 20-year time-span.  The Archive was created by examining all submitted manuscripts, matching them with reviewers, and using the internet to secure other information about authors and reviewers. This information was merged into four types of files, including author, reviewer, person, and manuscript information. Workshop participants will become familiar with the files and learn how to link them and/or how to use each separately, depending on the research question to be answered. Examining these files allows researchers to determine whether the peer networks of reviews are intellectually distant from those of authors, or whether both the author and the reviewer are in the same networks, thus suggesting the potential for reviewer bias.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Throughout its five years, this project will support two cohorts of 16 students who are pursuing baccalaureate degrees in Materials Science and Engineering, as well as Civil, Chemical, Electrical, Environmental, and Mechanical Engineering. Cohort-building activities will include an academic boot camp before the students' first college semester, and courses taken by all cohort members. The project will provide a monthly seminar series on topics such as internships, industry mentoring, undergraduate research, and international exchange programs. The project's activities have been positively linked to academic success. This project aims to achieve broader impact by contributing to state and federal strategic workforce diversification goals. Project activities that support these goals include engineering outreach programs and courses on engineering design for K-12 educators. It is expected that the project will generate new knowledge about how engineering education can be improved to better serve the growing number of lower-income, academically talented students entering college. The project will educate graduates who are prepared to directly enter graduate school or work in industry, thus contributing to developing a diverse, flexible, and well-educated STEM workforce. \n\nA mixed-methods research design will be used to study the effects of implemented practices on the self-efficacy and engineering identity of the student cohorts. The explicit research objective is to add to existing knowledge about student characteristics and issues that help low-income, academically high-achieving students succeed in engineering and related disciplines. This project will  fill gaps in knowledge about the development of self-efficacy and engineering identity in low-income, academically talented students. The project will also identify the most effective combinations of curricular and co-curricular activities that strengthen individual students' self-efficacy and identity, with the goal of developing intervention techniques that retain engineering majors through graduation and placement in industry or graduate school. Quantitative measurable outcomes will include increased student retention, increased cohort self-efficacy and identity statistics, higher-than-average graduation rates for the cohorts using evidence-based programs, and successful placement in industry or graduate school.  Qualitative measurable outcomes, determined by participant interviews and surveys, will include attainment of academic and personal goals, increased leadership skills and confidence levels, and established sense of community. These outcomes will be an important contribution to knowledge about recruitment and retention of low-income, academically high-achieving students in the engineering disciplines.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In order to encourage female leaders, many companies leverage diversity training initiatives or women-centered solutions, such as women's networking groups or leadership training. While these solutions have merits, they often place the burden of creating more gender inclusive organizations on women themselves. A more effective approach to enhance gender inclusivity is to understand the role that male leaders may play in supporting women's advancement within organizations. While many male leaders may understand the importance of supporting female leaders, they may not know how to effectively do so. This proposal seeks to identify effective behaviors of male champions for female leadership and for supporting gender equality in organizations. This research highlights ways in which males can contribute to gender inclusivity at work. Results from this project can inform organizations about how to influence, train, and encourage possible male champions to actively support female leadership in the workplace. \n\nMale champions, or male leaders who value diversity in the workplace and support advancing talented females to leader positions, have a critical role to play as agents of change to enhance gender equality. The purpose of this project is to identify the effective behaviors of male champions. Multiple studies that utilize different research designs and methods will be conducted to examine these behaviors. First, we will conduct a qualitative study, which utilizes interviews with male champions and those who have been supported by male champions, to determine key gender inclusive leadership behaviors. Themes derived from the interviews will be used to generate a quantitative measure of gender inclusive behaviors among male leaders. Second, we will conduct a quantitative study to examine the relationship between gender inclusive leader behaviors and workplace outcomes.

In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.\n\nThis project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Fundamentally new approaches that are designed specifically to address the challenges of limited-resource settings are needed. Utilizing paper as a substrate to develop biosensors is attractive because the resources required to produce them are minimal and the materials are ubiquitous and inexpensive.  This project will create new device designs that can enable paper-based biosensing.  Hydrophilic (wettable) channels will be patterned in paper using hydrophobic (non-wettable) barriers in order to control the transport of sample fluids by wicking.   In addition to devising a new strategy for bioanalysis in limited-resource settings, the broader impacts of this research program include the creation of educational opportunities for middle school students (hands-on workshops), high school students (device design challenges and summer internships), and science teachers (classroom kit development).\n\n\nDue to their low cost and ease of use, paper-based microfluidic devices have gained attention as a platform to develop point-of-use bioassays. Independent of the advances in assay development, the paper-based devices themselves, in spite of their vast potential to facilitate bioanalysis, have received surprisingly little attention. This project aims to build an integrated research and education program centered on developing novel paper-based microfluidic devices that can facilitate biosensing based on chemical and biochemical reactions that occur at the interfaces formed between converging liquid fronts. Devices exploiting this approach will facilitate multiplexed biosensing using assay formats that are traditionally considered to be incompatible with flow-based devices (e.g., chemical reactions). The central hypothesis of this research is that the material properties of the paper (e.g., porosity) and the transport of reaction products (e.g., by diffusion) will ultimately control the analytical performance of these paper-based biosensors. By studying these variables systematically, new strategies for low-cost, paper-based biosensing will be developed. Assays at fluidic interfaces will result in the formation of visible colors that will allow users to easily interpret the results of an assay via visual threshold (qualitative), visual comparisons of intensities to read guides (semi-quantitative), or with image analysis (quantitative). This research is significant because the devices derived from this program span a broad range of applications in bioanalysis and will serve as versatile tools for all forms of analytical chemistry. Potential applications include: (i) environmental monitoring of heavy metals, (ii) food security and nutrient density, (iii) detection of nucleic acids and proteins, and (iv) the development of diagnostic assays that are designed specifically for use in limited-resource settings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These words (e.g. this and that), known in linguistics as demonstratives, are typically used to focus the hearer's attention on entities in the speech situation. Over time, some of these words evolve and may develop various kinds of new functions such as connectives and hesitation signals. Despite the universality of demonstratives across languages, demonstratives differ in how they change and why they evolve in certain ways. Although demonstratives have long been a key research topic in linguistics, we know surprisingly little about how demonstratives and demonstrative-derived pragmatic markers are used in spontaneous face-to-face conversation. This is due to the fact that the most commonly used genres in linguistic analysis are written discourse and oral narratives rather than spoken discourse. The results and transcriptions will help applied linguists and L2 educators develop more effective materials for teaching Mandarin Chinese, a critical language designated by the U.S. government. The project database will enhance the infrastructure for language-related research and education, and will contribute to the training of students.  \n\nThis dissertation project recognizes the methodological limitations in previous text-based analyses and investigates how the distal demonstrative na 'that' is used in Mandarin Chinese everyday conversation from a discourse-pragmatic perspective. Apart from its canonical usage as a distal demonstrative, na has various kinds of extended and nuanced discourse functions. This project sets out to identify and classify different uses of na, with a special focus on its previously overlooked non-referential discourse pragmatic functions. More specifically, it will uncover sequential contexts, functional accounts, and positions of na using both a quantitative approach and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to offer a systematic analysis that accounts for all the occurrences and functions of na by speakers in actual everyday conversation. The secondary goal is to shed light on a better understanding of robust similarities and subtle language specific variations in the grammaticalization and/or pragmaticalization of demonstratives, particularly the non-deictic uses of pragmatic markers derived from demonstratives. This dissertation project will contribute to a deeper understanding of a common human language phenomenon with fresh data and from an interactional perspective.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\n\nFor the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Garden State LSAMP (GSLSAMP) program was established in 2009 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of New Jersey.  The eight public and private institutions that make up the GSLSAMP are diverse and include one community college and seven four-year institutions, including one private institution.  The institutions are Essex County College, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University New Brunswick and Newark, and William Paterson University.  The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) graduates with STEM degrees by 60% over the next five years.  This goal will be accomplished by integrating GSLSAMP efforts and proven best practices into institutional, local and regional efforts that encourage success in STEM including learning communities, research experiences, academic bootcamps, collaboration with the community colleges of the Northern New Jersey Bridges to the Baccalaureate, research conferences and advisement. It will also increase the number of urban minority students from GSLSAMP institutions pursuing graduate education and international experiences by 20% through integrated research experiences and graduate school preparation and advisement.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"\n\nThe knowledge generating research study seeks to understand the factors and mechanisms related to the GSLSAMP's successes in increasing the participation of URM students in STEM from several common and uncommon sources and their subsequent graduation with an undergraduate STEM degree.  The studies will potentially reveal the factors and mechanisms in the STEM academic pipeline that increase URM students' interests and efforts in pursuing graduate training and a career in STEM, which will lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.  An external evaluation team will implement both quantitative and qualitative instruments to assess the overall quality of the programs on the individual campuses as well as the entire alliance related to the overall goals of the project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\n\nSRI International (SRI) in partnership with Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall) will conduct an efficacy study of a new comprehensive science curriculum for middle grades 6-8 called Amplify Science Middle School (ASMS). This school science curriculum integrates disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. The overarching aim of the study will be to understand the impact of the curriculum on student achievement, classroom implementation, and teacher practice in relation to the recommendations of \"A Framework for K-12 Science Education\" and the Next Generation of Science Standards. While the number of states fully adopting NGSS hovers at around 20, nearly another 20 states have either incorporated the Framework or substantial portions of the NGSS into their state frameworks. Currently, the number of curriculum materials that have been designed for the Framework are relatively few, and thus the efficacy evidence basis for NGSS-designed curricula is limited. As more and more curriculum materials become available for supporting the Framework vision, the science education field needs rigorous research on the efficacy of curricula and the conditions required to implement them. ASMS is the Hall's first comprehensive 6-8 grade curriculum that has been designed specifically to meet the vision of the Framework and NGSS. Field trials of ASMS with more than 475 teachers and 34,000 students in a wide variety of settings, including urban, rural and suburban schools, have shown positive impact on student achievement, providing a compelling reason for a large-scale efficacy trial at this time.\n\nThe study will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods within an experimental design that will allow the examination of relations between contextual factors and student learning gains to help explain the results. Thus, this study will be important for moving education researchers toward increased understanding of how to meaningfully study and support teaching and learning in districts that will be trying to implement the next generation of science curriculum materials. Work will be conducted in districts with large numbers of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields so that educators can better understand the promise of NGSS-aligned curricula in promoting access and equity in science education. The research team will conduct a random assignment efficacy study in 7th grade classrooms beginning in academic year 2018-19 and following up with these students as 8th graders in academic year 2019-20. Teachers in both conditions will receive professional development on the NGSS; teachers in the treatment condition will also receive professional development in the use of the ASMS materials. The recruiting target is a sample of 48 middle schools within up to 6 medium to large districts in California and/or Washington. The researchers will attempt to recruit all middle schools and all 7th grade\nscience teachers in a district. It is anticipated that each school will have an average of two teachers teaching 3 sections of 7th grade science with 30 students per section for an approximate total of 96 teachers and 8,640 students. All students should have opportunities to learn science. This study will aim to draw valid inferences about the impact of curricula in districts with high concentrations of students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. This work will also contribute to the larger, nationwide effort to support standards-based instructional reforms in science by helping to identify conditions needed for successful implementation of NGSS-designed curriculum materials. The findings will provide an important basis for investments in new curriculum materials and will be of strong interest to those in science education and the learning sciences, as well as to district leaders and policymakers concerned with scaling up of rigorous curriculum.",

              "abstractText" : "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to enhance listening comprehension skills via an innovative interactive learning platform that aligns with Common Core State Standards for listening comprehension and uses best practices in game-based learning. In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.\n\nThis project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "All languages have words to indicate entities that are being referred to. These words (e.g. this and that), known in linguistics as demonstratives, are typically used to focus the hearer's attention on entities in the speech situation. Over time, some of these words evolve and may develop various kinds of new functions such as connectives and hesitation signals. Despite the universality of demonstratives across languages, demonstratives differ in how they change and why they evolve in certain ways. Although demonstratives have long been a key research topic in linguistics, we know surprisingly little about how demonstratives and demonstrative-derived pragmatic markers are used in spontaneous face-to-face conversation. This is due to the fact that the most commonly used genres in linguistic analysis are written discourse and oral narratives rather than spoken discourse. The results and transcriptions will help applied linguists and L2 educators develop more effective materials for teaching Mandarin Chinese, a critical language designated by the U.S. government. The project database will enhance the infrastructure for language-related research and education, and will contribute to the training of students.  \n\nThis dissertation project recognizes the methodological limitations in previous text-based analyses and investigates how the distal demonstrative na 'that' is used in Mandarin Chinese everyday conversation from a discourse-pragmatic perspective. Apart from its canonical usage as a distal demonstrative, na has various kinds of extended and nuanced discourse functions. This project sets out to identify and classify different uses of na, with a special focus on its previously overlooked non-referential discourse pragmatic functions. More specifically, it will uncover sequential contexts, functional accounts, and positions of na using both a quantitative approach and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to offer a systematic analysis that accounts for all the occurrences and functions of na by speakers in actual everyday conversation. The secondary goal is to shed light on a better understanding of robust similarities and subtle language specific variations in the grammaticalization and/or pragmaticalization of demonstratives, particularly the non-deictic uses of pragmatic markers derived from demonstratives. This dissertation project will contribute to a deeper understanding of a common human language phenomenon with fresh data and from an interactional perspective.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project will capture data and knowledge from the last generation of Tanana and Gwich'in Athabascan elders who were raised in tribal communities largely untouched by Western colonization.  This generation, now in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, are taking key knowledge and data sets with them as they die, leaving subsequent generations impacted by this loss of knowledge. \n\nThe project will document Indigenous Knowledge of resilience through a qualitative phenomenology framework in using semi-structured interviews conducted by community researchers with Indigenous elders of the Central and Upper Yukon Basin, born between the years 1920 and 1950. Primary research questions are:\n-\tHow have adaptation strategies changed over a lifetime?\n-\tHow did environmental changes trigger changes in community social structure?\n-\tWhat lessons about resilience can be learned from the generation that bridged the gap between largely traditional Athabascan lifestyle and Anglo-European colonization?\nInterviews will be conducted with up to six Elders from the central Yukon Athabascan region - a remote area that was one of the last areas in Alaska to experience colonization. This project is urgent as the Elders who are the subjects of this research project are near end of life with three of the original Elders identified for this project having passed away during the previous two years. Additionally, a rural, Alaskan Native person will be trained in the project methodology and taught to harness the tools of science in the preservation of culture.

              "abstractText" : "Short-term environmental disturbances and long-term environmental change have displaced millions worldwide. The US Gulf Coast region is especially vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes, sea level rise, land subsidence, and flooding. Some parishes in Louisiana have lost over 90% of their land, largely due to environmental changes. What socioeconomic and cultural factors influence perceptions of environment risk and migration? This project investigates factors not traditionally associated with the environment, including ties to place, strong social relationships, and counter perceptions of environmental risk, that might keep people in place, despite environmental risk. Migration theory suggests that behavior is largely linked to economic factors, such as income opportunities or life ambitions. This research, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, will investigate whether, and to what extent, environmental perceptions impact movement decisions. Improved understanding of movement decisions can inform local and state decision makers, yielding more precise composite descriptions of their constituents and likely behavioral outcomes, enabling better prediction of migration patterns and strategic planning. Environmental perceptions are also of value to the emergency and first-response communities when they confront new environmental dangers. The ability to better communicate environmental risk or danger can ultimately help to save lives.\n\nCharlotte Till, under the supervision of Dr. Shauna BurnSilver of Arizona State University, will explore the relationship between risk perceptions and migration decisions. This research will be conducted in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, an ideal setting for studying risk where there are both acute and chronic stressors on movement behavior. Hurricanes pose a severe seasonal threat to this area, but sea level rise and land subsidence represent cumulative risks and a new everyday reality for coastal people. During pilot study work in the area in 2016 the researchers found that relative to younger residents, older residents had less intention to leave despite known risks, and factors such as home, family, or community were important features of the environment. Based on survey and interview methodologies this research will first identify how the environment is perceived, and then investigate the influence of these perceptions on movement decisions. Survey responses will form the baseline data representing local perceptions, and then a subset of respondents will be invited to interviews allowing the investigator to explore movement logic(s) and the significance of identified influence factors for their decision making. Text analysis tools will be used to analyze interview data. Examples of the insights possible through the findings of this work include: how movement decisions are made, what factors result in place attachment outweighing risk, and how environmental factors interact with movement decisions. By actively incorporating individuals who do not move, this project is targeting an understudied but critical group for analyzing human movement patterns. By drawing participants directly from the parish this research may spur greater public engagement with science, contributing toward greater public scientific literacy. This research contributes to development of the migration literature on the role of the environment in movement decisions and factors impacting those decisions. This project will also facilitate improved understanding and engagement among communities, emergency managers, and municipal respresentatives.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make walking both safer and easier for transfemoral amputees. Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Gender equality is recognized as an important factor in catalyzing development and lifting communities out of poverty. Empowered women contribute to healthy and productive families, communities, and nations. An important step in doing this is to integrate high quality and timely gender analysis (examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and opportunities affect men, women, girls and boys in specific contexts), into decision-making and project planning. For both public and private sectors, early, action-oriented gender analysis is vital to tackle improve outcomes. In 2015 - 2016, OECD aid agencies spent, on average, $41.7 billion per year targeting gender equality and women's empowerment. Conservatively estimating that 3-5% of this expenditure is for gender analysis and action planning, that makes a market of $1.3-2.1 billion in the development sector alone. This project can potentially improve outcomes from that development funding.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a web-based application that automates the currently manual process of conducting gender analyses. This addresses a real world challenge faced by aid organizations to effectively integrate gender analyses into planning to inform effective and timely decision-making. Despite being a requirement by many organizations, there are procurement and contract delays, shortage of gender experts, and manual research and data collection.  This project will develop a machine learning model that leverages big data, APIs, and text-mining, driven by an analytic framework created by experts, to automate this process and deliver customized results instantly for a fraction of the cost. Phase I will build, train, and test the model for one sector and select countries. By the end of Phase I, the model will be tested and iterated to meet high quality control standards. Once validated, it will be ready to scale globally across sectors.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "There has arguably never been a more exciting time to be an engineer. In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.\n\nA two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment. Finally, the workshop will catalyze new research collaborations, projects, and funding proposals related to engineering practice. Workshop activities will incorporate discussions of missing voices and contexts in the literature to identify critical areas for future research that supports broadening participation. Anticipated outcomes include an editorial or position piece on the current state of research on engineering education and actionable guidelines for future research, an edited volume or special issue of a journal comprised of papers or commentaries on engineering education and practice, and a workshop summary report. A special session during the 2018 FIE conference is also planned, to share highlights from the workshop, provide preliminary guidance on methods and approaches for research on engineering practice, and further grow the community of interest among a larger number of potential participants.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "This SBIR Phase I project will produce a digital + physical game for 6-10 year olds that fosters computational thinking practices through collaboration, listening, and tinkering through play with music. It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.\n\n\nThe core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Advances in transportation systems, fueled by on-demand mobility-platforms, crowd-sourcing, ride-hailing and increasing automation, promise to enhance the livability and competitiveness of cities and rural areas globally. A fundamental question is whether these innovations will contribute to solving, or inadvertently exacerbate, critical challenges such as congestion, emissions and inequitable access to mobility. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) research addresses a gap in current approaches by integrating quantitative and qualitative multi-disciplinary insights and developing methods to study how society adapts to evolving mobility technologies. Integrating insights from the social sciences in existing passenger and logistics system models will help understand how adoption behaviors are affected by diverse community beliefs and culture in rapidly changing mobility contexts. This research will have far-reaching effects, delivering new tools to tailor transformative mobility solutions to citizens' needs, decongest urban networks and expand mobility to underserved communities. The project includes educational efforts where students evaluate engineering solutions that align with human behavior and livability goals. The project will also develop online educational material and training tools for Chicago high school teachers, to promote careers in engineering in diverse communities. \n\nThe goal of this project is to establish a new foundation and develop methods to better understand and predict impacts of emerging freight and passenger mobility adoption. Specifically, this research establishes an analytical community mobility adoption framework that integrates current quantitative theory, data and methods (i.e. formal surveys, discrete choice analysis and supervised learning) with qualitative social science perspectives (theory of social thresholds, ethnographic data on neighborhood-scale mobility behavior). Robust policy guidance tools derived through combining qualitative, participatory, multi-stakeholder research methods and formal policy scenario simulation are expected to inform communities' transition resulting from the potentially disruptive socio-technical changes in transportation mobility choices. The impact will be strengthened by integration with education and outreach approaches that inspire, challenge and educate future civil engineers to address mobility challenges with technically informed and culturally sensitive designs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Training engineering faculty in engineering education research expands the number of faculty adopting research-based instructional practices in their courses, and results in improved teaching, advising, programming, and policy-making by closing the research-to-practice gap.\n\nWhile previous mentorship models have focused on the content of engineering education as a field, this work identifies effective strategies from successful mentoring relationships that incorporate the social and cultural components of becoming an engineering education researcher. By conducting qualitative interviews of engineering faculty and engineering education researchers mentee-mentor pairs, the study the study develops a conceptual model of the formation of engineering education researchers' identity. This model clarifies how researchers undergo a paradigm shift and potential career pivot to expand their expertise in a related, but distinct, discipline of engineering education.

              "abstractText" : "Criminal courts that operate under the same formal law and policy often develop their own norms and practices, resulting in very different kinds of justice outcomes depending upon where a case is adjudicated. And when formal legal policies change, the reforms generally get implemented in distinct and divergent ways by local court actors, sometimes in ways inconsistent with policy goals. This project capitalizes upon recent major policy changes imposed in the federal criminal system by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to examine how different court \"communities\" have responded to the changes. Specifically, new policies have been developed urging prosecutors to focus on certain kinds of federal crimes, and that require prosecutors across the country to maximize the potential punishment. While the DOJ policies aim for standardized prosecutorial practices across the diverse federal district courts, prior research suggests that local courts will vary in how they translate these directives into action.  \n \nThe study builds directly upon the PI's previous NSF-funded research that examined jurisdictional differences in adjudication strategies in federal court, using both qualitative field methods and quantitative methods. The project revisits the same research sites (4 geographically and demographically diverse federal districts) to assess whether and how the current DOJ policy impacts caseload characteristics (including defendant demography) and adjudication practices and outcomes, with a focus on how formal top-down policy is translated into localized, on-the-ground legal action. Using interviews, observations, and administrative data from the federal courts, the project tests three related hypotheses: 1) Despite the return to policies that aim to control local practices through top-down mandates, adaptations will be localized in practice. Between-district variations will continue to be evident in four distinct sets of practices: case selection; prosecutorial charging practices; terms and modes of plea agreements; and formal sentencing practices. 2) Within-district, demographic composition of the caseload, the application of prosecutorial-controlled sentencing tools, and sentence lengths will change as a function of temporal period, but local adjudication norms will temper such change. 3) The degree of change in local practice norms will be greater in the current policy period (beginning May, 2017) than the previous one (2010-2017) because the current policy authorizes increased punishment for defendants and includes local compliance mechanisms.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite these frequent attributions, there is scant empirical evidence about how people view the role of luck in their lives, and how these views vary across the population. This proposal will analyze how people define luck, their views about the influence of luck on individual outcomes, and the aspects of their lives, e.g., financial success, job status, health, personal relationships, to which they apply luck. A critical component of the research will evaluate the extent to which people attribute socioeconomic outcomes to luck as compared with individual talents and effort. A better understanding of these perceptions will shed new light on views about social inequality, the factors that lead to success and failure, and individual motivations. These findings will provide new information to help individuals in society reflect upon the relative roles of luck, talent, and effort as reasons for their own outcomes as well as the outcomes for others in society.    \n \n \nThis proposal will conduct in-depth, open-ended interviews with a broadly representative national sample of 100 U.S. adults.

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship provides an emerging scholar-scientist with an opportunity to investigate the ways in which diverse Black families navigate the racial socialization of their youth in the 21st century. The well-being of Black children in the United States is a matter of grave public health significance. The unfortunate realities of Ferguson, MI, Baltimore, MD, Sanford, FL, Charleston, SC, McKinney, TX, Cleveland, OH, and Chicago, IL, have left many in our society with questions about how to provide youth with the triumvirate \"affection, protection, and correction\"  required to optimize their psychosocial wellbeing. Racial socialization (RS) is a process that has been associated with a number of positive outcomes. However, this research has largely assessed Black mothers (of mother-father households), has predominately used survey data, and has focused on retrospective reporting of RS, limiting our conceptual understanding of a crucial parenting practice. This project addresses these limitations, expanding the study of RS in a number of important ways.\n\nThe project, entitled the \"Black Family Racial Socialization Project\" focuses on the development of three studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods, from the perspective of both parents and youth. The primary aim of the first study is to use survey and interview methods to elucidate the ways in which Black families representing a diverse structural spectrum (e.g., extended kin, blended families, LGBT couples) prepare themselves to undertake the RS of their children. The primary aim of the second study is to capture the synergistic and bidirectional nature of RS \"in the moment\", by using media (e.g., TV scenes, song lyrics, social media posts) to create and code ecologically-valid, family-level racial socialization conversations. The primary aim of the third study is to prospectively assess how Black parents and Black parents-to-be anticipate teaching their children about race \"in the future\". This study will utilize annual interviews and biannual surveys to monitor how intentions to socialize Black youth (and actual socialization behaviors) change over time, and to elucidate the principal factors that instigate such changes. Together, this research will lead to the development of a more complete conceptual framework that can be tested and instituted in future investigations. In addition, the findings from this research are expected to contribute to the development of effective interventions for Black families.",

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a particular suite of computational tools for summarizing and visualizing shape in high-dimensional data sets. These tools have been used in recent years to guide new discoveries in cancer research, neuroscience, materials science, image analysis, and many areas where shape, broadly construed, is of importance. However, by summarizing data in a succinct way certain important differences between data sets can often go undetected. This project provides a new mathematical framework for precisely measuring how lossy the most popular methods in TDA are. By developing new ways for quantifying how large-scale differences go undetected, the project offers enrichments of current topological methods to obtain novel data science tools with greater distinguishing power. The awarded funds will go primarily to fund a graduate student to aid the PI in basic research and development of these enriched topological summaries. Computational experiments on data sets of public interest, e.g. time-varying socio-economic indicators and weather data, will be carried out to test performance of these tools against current state of the art methods. Additionally, the PI will incorporate these novel methods into the data science curriculum at the PI's host institution and recruit students from historically under-represented groups to be trained as the nation's next generation of data scientists.\n\nThis project is an ambitious extension of earlier work undertaken by the PI and provides a targeted attack on the inverse problem for the main objects of study in topological data analysis: the merge tree, which tracks how connected components of the sub-level set of a function evolves; Reeb graphs, which tracks connected components of the fiber of a function; and the barcode/persistence diagram, which is a collection of intervals/points in the plane that represent an algorithmic pairing of critical points of a function on a space. The PI showed in earlier work how merge trees determine the associated barcode and provided a precise enumeration of how many distinct merge trees have the same barcode. By identifying functions on the real line that are related by an orientation preserving coordinate transformation, the PI showed how a novel enrichment of the merge tree---the chiral merge tree---faithfully captures these equivalence classes of functions and offers exponential distinguishing power over the barcode for time-series analysis. This project aims to carry out similar analysis for functions on surfaces, with an eye toward improving the classification performance of persistent homology in image analysis, and for Reeb graphs, to better integrate with level-set persistent homology. By carrying out a careful study of inverse problems in each of these settings, novel enrichments analogous to the chiral merge tree will be developed. Additionally, to make these enriched topological summaries useful for data classification tasks, novel metrics will be defined for comparing each of these summaries and algorithms will be developed for the efficient computation of these metrics.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

International development groups refer to these as \"child marriages\" and consider them to be damaging to well-being, particularly for girls. Therefore, with wide support from Western nations, including the United States, significant resources are invested in campaigns to eradicate these practices. However, this movement has also been critiqued for relying on a notion that there is a clear and absolute boundary between childhood and adulthood that lies at 18 years. In fact, there is surprisingly little objective information available about why \"child marriage\" remains prevalent in some places despite its purported harmful consequences. The research supported by this award will address this question. Results from the project will support policy recommendations, and contribute to a wider critical engagement with the notion that early transitions to adulthood are necessarily harmful in all circumstances. \n\nResearch will be carried out in north western Tanzania among a Sukuma population where around one-third of girls marry before 18 years. Data collection will take place within a demographic surveillance site managed by the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research. Taking a mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected over a two-year period. To build an understanding of early marriage grounded in ethnographic reality, rather than stereotype, the project will first utilize focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify perceived risks to wellbeing that characterize female adolescence and the role of early marriage in elevating or mitigating such risk. Multiple dimensions of female wellbeing (physical and mental health, education, food security, empowerment, and community respect) will then be assessed via a large quantitative survey, and analyzed to determine if 18 years emerges as a meaningful threshold demarcating harmful marriage, or whether alternative age categorizations, if any, better predict variation in wellbeing. Quantitative and qualitative data will then be used test the hypotheses that early marriage is either the product of parental coercion and a parent-offspring conflict of interests, or whether it is better understood as a parental strategy to enhance the success of daughters. Finally, the project will quantify associations between age at menarche, first reproduction and marriage to explore hypothesized links between physiological and behavioral transitions into adulthood.

Fundamentally new approaches that are designed specifically to address the challenges of limited-resource settings are needed. Utilizing paper as a substrate to develop biosensors is attractive because the resources required to produce them are minimal and the materials are ubiquitous and inexpensive.  This project will create new device designs that can enable paper-based biosensing.  Hydrophilic (wettable) channels will be patterned in paper using hydrophobic (non-wettable) barriers in order to control the transport of sample fluids by wicking.   In addition to devising a new strategy for bioanalysis in limited-resource settings, the broader impacts of this research program include the creation of educational opportunities for middle school students (hands-on workshops), high school students (device design challenges and summer internships), and science teachers (classroom kit development).\n\n\nDue to their low cost and ease of use, paper-based microfluidic devices have gained attention as a platform to develop point-of-use bioassays. Independent of the advances in assay development, the paper-based devices themselves, in spite of their vast potential to facilitate bioanalysis, have received surprisingly little attention. This project aims to build an integrated research and education program centered on developing novel paper-based microfluidic devices that can facilitate biosensing based on chemical and biochemical reactions that occur at the interfaces formed between converging liquid fronts. Devices exploiting this approach will facilitate multiplexed biosensing using assay formats that are traditionally considered to be incompatible with flow-based devices (e.g., chemical reactions). The central hypothesis of this research is that the material properties of the paper (e.g., porosity) and the transport of reaction products (e.g., by diffusion) will ultimately control the analytical performance of these paper-based biosensors. By studying these variables systematically, new strategies for low-cost, paper-based biosensing will be developed. Assays at fluidic interfaces will result in the formation of visible colors that will allow users to easily interpret the results of an assay via visual threshold (qualitative), visual comparisons of intensities to read guides (semi-quantitative), or with image analysis (quantitative). This research is significant because the devices derived from this program span a broad range of applications in bioanalysis and will serve as versatile tools for all forms of analytical chemistry. Potential applications include: (i) environmental monitoring of heavy metals, (ii) food security and nutrient density, (iii) detection of nucleic acids and proteins, and (iv) the development of diagnostic assays that are designed specifically for use in limited-resource settings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Participants will receive coaching to prepare for graduate school and professional development, and they will be mentored into becoming independent creative thinkers and researchers. Participants will gain experience in scientific dissemination and communication, including publishing in professional conferences and journals, and giving scientific presentations.\n\nLong range HF communications work by the reflection of radio waves by the ionosphere layer of the atmosphere. These communications can travel around curvature of the earth, and work without the need for significant infrastructure like satellites, cellular networks, internet, etc. The challenge with HF communications is that propagation via the ionosphere may be unreliable, the ionospheric conditions may change very rapidly, and different frequencies have different propagation characteristics via the ionosphere. Successful communication depends on the time of day, location of users, selection of frequency, modulation, antenna type, and power level.

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\n\nFor the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Garden State LSAMP (GSLSAMP) program was established in 2009 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of New Jersey.  The eight public and private institutions that make up the GSLSAMP are diverse and include one community college and seven four-year institutions, including one private institution.  The institutions are Essex County College, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University New Brunswick and Newark, and William Paterson University.  The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) graduates with STEM degrees by 60% over the next five years.  This goal will be accomplished by integrating GSLSAMP efforts and proven best practices into institutional, local and regional efforts that encourage success in STEM including learning communities, research experiences, academic bootcamps, collaboration with the community colleges of the Northern New Jersey Bridges to the Baccalaureate, research conferences and advisement. It will also increase the number of urban minority students from GSLSAMP institutions pursuing graduate education and international experiences by 20% through integrated research experiences and graduate school preparation and advisement.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"\n\nThe knowledge generating research study seeks to understand the factors and mechanisms related to the GSLSAMP's successes in increasing the participation of URM students in STEM from several common and uncommon sources and their subsequent graduation with an undergraduate STEM degree.  The studies will potentially reveal the factors and mechanisms in the STEM academic pipeline that increase URM students' interests and efforts in pursuing graduate training and a career in STEM, which will lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.  An external evaluation team will implement both quantitative and qualitative instruments to assess the overall quality of the programs on the individual campuses as well as the entire alliance related to the overall goals of the project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a serious complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is the leading cause of kidney failure. Yet, it is still not clear how the many underlying chemical, physical, and biological processes interact to damage the kidneys during diabetes. It is challenging to monitor the damage to the kidneys inside a patient. The regions of the kidney that are damaged are very small and are deep within the body. It takes a long time for irreversible damage to accumulate to the point where non-invasive urine samples contain detectable quantities of proteins that leaked through the kidneys. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will connect several processes that have been shown individually to contribute to injury in kidneys due to diabetes into a sophisticated computer simulation. This computational tool will aid in understanding how the processes interact and how diabetic kidney damage begins and changes over time. In the long-term, results from this project will help to predict the impacts of many competing factors on kidney health during diabetes management. The computer simulation produced in the project can also be used to test and optimize treatments to slow the progression of DKD. The project also will involve a set of educational activities related to the scientific work. Several undergraduate and graduate students including women and underrepresented minorities will work with the PI to conduct the research and educational activities. Educational modules related to the research will be delivered to a variety of groups including K-12 students, college students, and grandparents. Physical models of kidney tissues will be 3D-printed and shared with students and educators. The activities will expose many students and members of the public to biomedical engineering and computational science through engaging scientific demonstrations and interactive experiences.\n\nThe principal investigator's long-term career goal is to develop multiscale computational models to enhance understanding of the mechanisms governing tissue remodeling and damage as a result of diseases and infections and to simulate the treatment of those conditions to improve human health.  Toward this goal, this project will develop a novel computational approach for studying diabetic kidney disease (DKD) through a virtual kidney that can be used like a powerful, non-invasive microscope to look into the body to detect and monitor damage to the glomeruli (where most damage occurs) during the onset and progression of diabetic complications in the kidney. The virtual kidney platform will use multiscale computational modeling to connect effects at different length scales from smaller to larger: inside cells, between adjacent cells, across a single glomerulus, and among collections of glomeruli interacting with other tissues in a kidney. A hybrid computational approach will take advantage of the benefits of stochastic differential equations to describe chemical species that react and interact in large quantities and of agent-based models to describe cells and chemical species that interact in small quantities or in qualitative up- or down-regulation fashions.  The Research Plan is organized under two aims.  The FIRST AIM is to formulate cellular level mathematical models of biochemical cell signaling networks responsible for damage in each of the three main glomerular zones: a) podocytes, b) mesangial cells and mesangial matrix and c) endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane.  Computational tools will be developed for importing biochemical networks, conducting uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, and validating model results for the three zones.  To assess validity, computational models will be compared to experimental evidence gleaned from the literature. The SECOND AIM is to build a virtual kidney computational model focusing on crosstalk, structural, and hemodynamic effects on the primary tissue compartments within multiple nephrons.  Steps include:  a) constructing a hybrid computational model for tissue level simulation of glomerular cells that combines information from reactions in single cells, connects multiple interacting cells and transports glucose and other molecules through the mesangium and the glomerular filtration barrier; b) connecting the glomerular models to a tubule and vessel centric-model for blood flow and filtration regulation and c) validating the virtual kidney model and simulating responses to stimuli.  A user-friendly interface will be created for specifying model input and stimuli, running the simulations, and visualizing results.  Simulations of the virtual kidney model will be rigorously compared to pharmacological, physiological, and histological data, primarily from humans.  After model validation to a subset of the data cases, in silico experiments will be conducted to predict the magnitudes and rates of change for glomerular injury outcomes including proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under DKD pathophysiological conditions.  The metric for success will be the accurate simulation of the classic trajectory of onset and progression of DKD subject to clinically relevant input and stimuli.  Computational tools and code developed will be distributed openly via GitHub repositories, which may be of broad interest to the systems biology research community using SBML and/or CompuCell3D.  In summary, the project addresses the critical need to compile the multiple mechanistic processes that contribute to DKD onset and progression into a user-friendly systematic framework capable of taking the interconnected chemical, physical, and biological factors into account in a coupled fashion and in the appropriate magnitudes and sequences to make testable predictions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The researcher will develop a comparative study of three cities: Belfast, Melbourne, and Bombay. She will focus on the microbe, the colonial administrator, and the bacteriologist as the central actors in each of the three cases. She will do so by engaging in a study of archival documents and other sources to obtain a deeper understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that make each region unique. She plans to show how specific features of the local environment in these three regions, when combined with plans of sanitary improvement and land use change espoused by the British Empire, served to produce unique environments in which particular microbes thrived. The proposed project draws from multiple disciplinary sources and is intended for multiple disciplinary audiences. The researcher plans to disseminate her research results at conferences and workshops sponsored by history departments, epidemiology and public health departments, public health policy centers, and organizations that engage in climate studies.\n\nThis project uses a historical frame while engaging with a number of central topics in the field of science and technology studies. It engages with the concept of nonhuman agency with its focus on the ecological specificity of microbes, and it uses Niche Construction Theory to access the localized environments and to draw out their relationship to microbial actors. Cultural construction of science and technology, particularly as it relates to imperialism and nineteenth century colonial practices, will also be an important element of consideration to this project. Using relatively new social scientific frameworks to guide this history, this project will engage with STS in its goal to induce new consideration of the agency of living objects and actor-network theory as a viable historical and social scientific frame.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The strategy will be to study a demonstrated successful learning model that integrates traditional high school STEM curriculum with real world projects from the STEM business community. The study will illuminate how the components of the program work together to support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers, in particular female and minority students. The findings of the study will make it possible to implement the program in similar contexts across the nation. A better understanding of experiential learning within a public school district context can potentially impact tens of thousands of students. \n\nThe goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory case study of Blue Valley Center for Advanced Professional Studies (BVCAPS) which is the founding location of the Center for Advanced Professional Studies (CAPS) network. CAPS will provide programming that includes STEM capstone experiences (in medicine, bioscience, technology, or engineering) for public school high school juniors and seniors. Guided by the theoretical and conceptual constructs of social cognitive career theory and high-quality project-based learning, this study will seek to answer the following research questions: 1) How does the CAPS model support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers? 2) What aspects of the BVCAPS model contribute to increased female and under-represented minority student motivation and preparation for STEM careers? The qualitative exploration will be used to create a set of validated and reliable instruments that can be used to study this and similar programs more broadly as they relate to motivation and preparation for STEM careers. This study will build on the literature in high school STEM education in the area of project-based learning and capstone experiences in high school and add to the developing literature on high school STEM experiential learning. Measurement tools created by this study will enable examination of the capstone model in programs within the network of schools (over 10,000 students in more than 80 school districts within 13 states across the US) and more broadly. In addition to the potential impact of the measurement tools themselves, the findings of this study will address how other STEM educators can support the motivation and preparation for students in STEM careers, in particular female and minorities. Information gleaned in this area will help advance high school STEM reform and preparation for post-secondary careers and learning opportunities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Findings from this research are used to develop training materials and inform a networking event intended to pair engineering faculty interested in engineering education research with potential mentors at different institutions.  Training engineering faculty in engineering education research expands the number of faculty adopting research-based instructional practices in their courses, and results in improved teaching, advising, programming, and policy-making by closing the research-to-practice gap.\n\nWhile previous mentorship models have focused on the content of engineering education as a field, this work identifies effective strategies from successful mentoring relationships that incorporate the social and cultural components of becoming an engineering education researcher. By conducting qualitative interviews of engineering faculty and engineering education researchers mentee-mentor pairs, the study the study develops a conceptual model of the formation of engineering education researchers' identity. This model clarifies how researchers undergo a paradigm shift and potential career pivot to expand their expertise in a related, but distinct, discipline of engineering education. This novel approach provides important information to enhance existing training materials and to develop additional training opportunities for engineering faculty who are interested in conducting engineering education research.

This project will capitalize on the societal interest in cybersecurity and cryptography and explore how the skills that underlie the encrypting and decrypting practices in cryptography parallel the skills that children must develop to become successful readers and writers. Given the importance of cryptography and cybersecurity, the project will introduce a new technology-enhanced STEM education model for engaging children of 7-10 years old, particularly girls, in cryptography and cybersecurity building and STEM identity development as they make and break secret codes. The mystery of the subject, its relevance in today's society, and interactive learning experiences will engage children, and the after-school environment where the project will be performed will provide a safe space for them to learn at their own pace. The important scientific and educational outcomes will include improved understanding of how literacy, self-efficacy, computational thinking, 21st century skills, and interest in cryptography and cybersecurity can be fostered at the elementary school level.\n\nThe focus of this project is to conduct a systematic investigation of the effective conditions for designing and implementing touch-screen enhanced visuospatial learning curricula that foster STEM interest and career awareness using the unique context of cryptography. An interdisciplinary team of K-12 after-school teacher leaders, education technologists, special educators, computer scientists, and STEM education researchers will design a 6-week, 24-hour program of cryptography focused apps and activities for upper elementary students (grades 3-5) in after-school programs that serve primarily girls and African American students. To encourage adoption and facilitate dissemination, the Codebreakers curriculum will be available online in the form of an interactive, touch-friendly website. A mixed-method research design will employ a range of methods including phenomenology, comparative case studies, pretest-posttest analyses, and mixed-effects modeling. The project will use qualitative data to explore students' and teachers' perceptions and experiences with the Codebreakers activities and technology. Quantitative data will be used to make inferences regarding the quantifiable impacts of the strategy on the development of students' self-efficacy, interest and identity in STEM, evolution of their understanding of cryptography and cybersecurity, and the development of their morphological awareness. Ongoing professional development (PD) and support will be provided face-to-face during bi-weekly meetings with teacher leaders and using the Codebreakers online social network.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\n\nSRI International (SRI) in partnership with Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall) will conduct an efficacy study of a new comprehensive science curriculum for middle grades 6-8 called Amplify Science Middle School (ASMS). This school science curriculum integrates disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. The overarching aim of the study will be to understand the impact of the curriculum on student achievement, classroom implementation, and teacher practice in relation to the recommendations of \"A Framework for K-12 Science Education\" and the Next Generation of Science Standards. While the number of states fully adopting NGSS hovers at around 20, nearly another 20 states have either incorporated the Framework or substantial portions of the NGSS into their state frameworks. Currently, the number of curriculum materials that have been designed for the Framework are relatively few, and thus the efficacy evidence basis for NGSS-designed curricula is limited. As more and more curriculum materials become available for supporting the Framework vision, the science education field needs rigorous research on the efficacy of curricula and the conditions required to implement them. ASMS is the Hall's first comprehensive 6-8 grade curriculum that has been designed specifically to meet the vision of the Framework and NGSS. Field trials of ASMS with more than 475 teachers and 34,000 students in a wide variety of settings, including urban, rural and suburban schools, have shown positive impact on student achievement, providing a compelling reason for a large-scale efficacy trial at this time.\n\nThe study will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods within an experimental design that will allow the examination of relations between contextual factors and student learning gains to help explain the results. Thus, this study will be important for moving education researchers toward increased understanding of how to meaningfully study and support teaching and learning in districts that will be trying to implement the next generation of science curriculum materials. Work will be conducted in districts with large numbers of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields so that educators can better understand the promise of NGSS-aligned curricula in promoting access and equity in science education. The research team will conduct a random assignment efficacy study in 7th grade classrooms beginning in academic year 2018-19 and following up with these students as 8th graders in academic year 2019-20. Teachers in both conditions will receive professional development on the NGSS; teachers in the treatment condition will also receive professional development in the use of the ASMS materials. The recruiting target is a sample of 48 middle schools within up to 6 medium to large districts in California and/or Washington. The researchers will attempt to recruit all middle schools and all 7th grade\nscience teachers in a district. It is anticipated that each school will have an average of two teachers teaching 3 sections of 7th grade science with 30 students per section for an approximate total of 96 teachers and 8,640 students. All students should have opportunities to learn science. This study will aim to draw valid inferences about the impact of curricula in districts with high concentrations of students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. This work will also contribute to the larger, nationwide effort to support standards-based instructional reforms in science by helping to identify conditions needed for successful implementation of NGSS-designed curriculum materials. The findings will provide an important basis for investments in new curriculum materials and will be of strong interest to those in science education and the learning sciences, as well as to district leaders and policymakers concerned with scaling up of rigorous curriculum.",

Ordinarily, the term fraud is applied to illegal behavior. Globally, however, fraud allegations seem increasingly to provide a more general language to express extreme dissatisfaction with both instiutions and individuals for actions that range from the merely misleading to the truly unlawful. This research investigates why the use of the language of fraud has expanded, the political and social effects this entails, and how people re-build trust in the wake of perceived betrayals. The research is important because trust is necessary for healthy economies and robust democratic political systems. Research findings will therefore be of interest to both policy makers and citizens who seek to promote civic participation and economic development.\n\nThe research will be undertaken in the conjoined cities of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia. This site was chosen due to Bolivia's long history of donor-sponsored (including American-backed) rule-of-law reforms and concurrent projects encouraging entrepreneurship and the financial inclusion of the poor. Indeed, Bolivian fraud accusations frequently sit at the intersection of these two objectives: urging people to embrace entrepreneurship to lift themselves from poverty and ongoing efforts to stem economic crimes. The project builds on the researcher's decade-long fieldwork in Bolivia, allowing for longitudinal analyses and comparative data collection and the efficient use of funding. The researcher will gather data through a combination of qualitative research methods, including ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and archival research. Interviews will be conducted with regulatory officials, jurists, foreign donors, and NGO representatives to investigate the priority given to economic crimes and specifically fraud as an object of intervention. Archival data will provide insights into shifting regulations, historic pyramid scheme cases, and patterns in criminal cases related to fraud. Ethnographic research will focus on pyramid schemes and quasi-legal multilevel marketing companies. Findings from this research will illuminate the history, uses, and effects of fraud accusations and contribute to social science theory of fraud as a changing global category.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For example, to understand the statement, \"Give me the book on AI on the table to your left,\" a robot needs to understand that the first \"on\" expresses the topic of the book, while the second \"on\" and the rest of the sentence convey spatial information. Next, it needs to work out the visual meaning of \"on\" to identify the correct book. Spatial language understanding is challenging because it requires meaning disambiguation, recognizing the links between referenced objects, and in most cases, background knowledge and common sense. This is particularly true for more complex sentences that include nesting relations or idioms containing spatial terms, like \"she is the top expert in her field.\" The goal of this research is to develop techniques for the integration of machine learning and reasoning to advance spatial language comprehension. Solving this problem will provide tangible benefits to society in a wide variety of applications including healthcare (e.g., extracting biomedical information from patient reports and images), navigation and communication with assistant robots (particularly in risky situations like firefighter robots), situational awareness, information retrieval systems using various types of data, and geographical information systems.\n\nProviding reasoning capabilities to machine learning models is highly challenging. The proposed research advances this issue in an important and broad sub-problem: spatial language understanding. To this aim, a generic domain-independent symbolic spatial meaning representation will be introduced, which covers the main spatial semantic concepts for a variety of tasks. Deep structured and relational learning techniques will be developed to obtain such representations. The proposed techniques will facilitate indirect supervision by exploiting visual resources, will use ontologies that convey common sense and will integrate the axioms of spatial qualitative reasoning in training structured representations. Such an approach helps to avoid massive and complex data annotation for training structured and complex models. This research will evaluate whether using formal spatial calculi models as an intermediate structured representation will improve spatial reasoning and deeper learning. The interaction between learning and spatial reasoning will be investigated, while exploiting both symbolic and sub-symbolic representations. The impact of integrating explicit spatial reasoning will be tested on textual and visual question-answering tasks with a focus on locative questions. The outcome of this research will advance the generalizability of current state-of-the-art deep learning models at a time when there is a lack of training examples for complex unobserved situations. This work will help bridge the gap between symbolic AI and deep ML to advance spatial language understanding. The project will support research and education for graduate and undergraduate students and increase the contribution of women and minorities in STEM.\n\nThis award is jointly funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research in the Office of Integrative Activities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Much of science is found in peer-reviewed journals. However, researchers in the history or sociology of science cannot study what is accepted and what is rejected in these journals because until recently they did not have access to a body of data that included accepted and rejected manuscripts, the topics covered, the characteristics of those who submitted manuscripts, and the comments of the reviewers.  Moreover, they did not have such data over time, so that they might see changes within a discipline in terms of topics and submitters.  The American Sociological Association (ASA) has electronic copies of all the manuscripts and all the reviews for ASA journals for a twenty-year period between 1991 and 2010.  Based on a prior three-year, NSF-funded project, the Center for Social Science Research (CSSR) at the George Mason University has created a Digital Archive that contains this information for the American Sociological Review, the ASA top journal.   Given the complexities of the Archive data file, CSSR will hold a two-day workshop so that interested scholars can be trained to use it to answer critical questions about the history and development of sociology in a time-period of pronounced changes in the discipline.  Faculty trained on the use of the archive will pass on this knowledge to their colleagues in sociology and other disciplines to further the study of the peer-review system for a flagship journal. This project is beneficial because it allows for scrutiny of the scientific process.\n\nThis project will support a two-day workshop to be held in April 2019 to train faculty and graduate students in the use of the ASA/Mason American Sociological Review (ASR) Digital Archive.  The Center for Social Science Research (CSSR) at the George Mason University has created a Digital Archive of more than 8,000 manuscripts and 26,000 reviews. The Archive includes demographic and institutional information of authors and reviews over a 20-year time-span.  The Archive was created by examining all submitted manuscripts, matching them with reviewers, and using the internet to secure other information about authors and reviewers. This information was merged into four types of files, including author, reviewer, person, and manuscript information. Workshop participants will become familiar with the files and learn how to link them and/or how to use each separately, depending on the research question to be answered. Examining these files allows researchers to determine whether the peer networks of reviews are intellectually distant from those of authors, or whether both the author and the reviewer are in the same networks, thus suggesting the potential for reviewer bias.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The phenomenon of language shift, in which a community ceases to speak their heritage language in favor of another (typically more socially and economically prestigious) language, has long been of interest to linguists and anthropologists. For immigrants to the United States and other countries, it is an often-repeated \"rule\" that language shift typically occurs by the third generation (i.e., the grandchildren of the original immigrants). This project, which trains a student in rigorous, empirically-grounded methods of data collection and analysis in cultural and linguistic anthropology, asks what factors might contribute to influence language shift among an earlier generational cohort. Additionally, the researcher explores whether there are grammatical, phonological or other patterns that can be identified in first-generation language shift, and how speakers navigate overlapping identities in the new cultural context. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in linguistics and anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to improve public understanding of indigeneity, language shift, and multilingualism. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and contributes to the education of underrepresented groups. \n\nUnder the supervision of Dr. Mary Bucholtz at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Anna Bax will work with a selected cohort of Mixtec women who grew up in Ventura County, California to understand how they variably use Spanish, English, and Mixtec for identity construction purposes. In Ventura County, the majority of the indigenous immigrant community is of Mixtec heritage and speak Mixtec languages, which are native to southern Mexico and differ radically from Spanish. This linguistic and anthropological project explores the question of how young women in this diasporic community, who may face gendered expectations to maintain their heritage language and culture, navigate the accelerated process of first-generation language shift. It seeks to address the following research questions: (1) How is Mixtec identity linguistically constructed, even as many community members are losing the ability to speak Mixtec entirely? How can Spanish and English linguistic resources come to symbolize Mixtec identity in the wake of this loss? (2) What strategies do individual participants use to navigate community language shift, and how do they balance their overlapping identities as indigenous Mexicans and as new members of American society? The researcher will take a case-study approach, using linguistic-anthropological and sociophonetic methods to explore how these young women maintain strong links to their indigenous identity, even as some of them have lost the ability to speak their heritage language. Participant-observation and ethnographic interviews will be conducted with this focal set of youth, as well as with key members of their social networks. In order to collect rich, detailed data about the participants' varying linguistic repertoires, they will also audio-record their own speech practices in naturalistic interaction in different social settings, so as to document shifts in their use of the focal linguistic variables and their performances of indigenous identity. The researcher will conduct a quantitative sociophonetic analysis of one Spanish and one English linguistic variable, with a focus on the connections of these variables to indigenous identity and how the use of the variables differs across social contexts. The participants' speech will also be compared to a corpus of local Chicanas' speech to understand the social construction of linguistic difference and/or similarity. Qualitative discourse-analytic methods will be used to understand the social meanings attached to these variables, as well as the meaning of participants' Mixtec code-switching practices. The results of this research will benefit local community centers who are invested in the maintenance of indigenous languages, and will be used to inform local public and educational policymaking about linguistic diversity. In addition, the project directly benefits the young indigenous participants, most of whom are current college students, by centrally involving them in STEM research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Throughout its five years, this project will support two cohorts of 16 students who are pursuing baccalaureate degrees in Materials Science and Engineering, as well as Civil, Chemical, Electrical, Environmental, and Mechanical Engineering. Cohort-building activities will include an academic boot camp before the students' first college semester, and courses taken by all cohort members. The project will provide a monthly seminar series on topics such as internships, industry mentoring, undergraduate research, and international exchange programs. The project's activities have been positively linked to academic success. This project aims to achieve broader impact by contributing to state and federal strategic workforce diversification goals. Project activities that support these goals include engineering outreach programs and courses on engineering design for K-12 educators. It is expected that the project will generate new knowledge about how engineering education can be improved to better serve the growing number of lower-income, academically talented students entering college. The project will educate graduates who are prepared to directly enter graduate school or work in industry, thus contributing to developing a diverse, flexible, and well-educated STEM workforce. \n\nA mixed-methods research design will be used to study the effects of implemented practices on the self-efficacy and engineering identity of the student cohorts. The explicit research objective is to add to existing knowledge about student characteristics and issues that help low-income, academically high-achieving students succeed in engineering and related disciplines. This project will  fill gaps in knowledge about the development of self-efficacy and engineering identity in low-income, academically talented students. The project will also identify the most effective combinations of curricular and co-curricular activities that strengthen individual students' self-efficacy and identity, with the goal of developing intervention techniques that retain engineering majors through graduation and placement in industry or graduate school. Quantitative measurable outcomes will include increased student retention, increased cohort self-efficacy and identity statistics, higher-than-average graduation rates for the cohorts using evidence-based programs, and successful placement in industry or graduate school.  Qualitative measurable outcomes, determined by participant interviews and surveys, will include attainment of academic and personal goals, increased leadership skills and confidence levels, and established sense of community.

              "abstractText" : "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to enhance listening comprehension skills via an innovative interactive learning platform that aligns with Common Core State Standards for listening comprehension and uses best practices in game-based learning. In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.\n\nThis project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "All languages have words to indicate entities that are being referred to. These words (e.g. this and that), known in linguistics as demonstratives, are typically used to focus the hearer's attention on entities in the speech situation. Over time, some of these words evolve and may develop various kinds of new functions such as connectives and hesitation signals. Despite the universality of demonstratives across languages, demonstratives differ in how they change and why they evolve in certain ways. Although demonstratives have long been a key research topic in linguistics, we know surprisingly little about how demonstratives and demonstrative-derived pragmatic markers are used in spontaneous face-to-face conversation. This is due to the fact that the most commonly used genres in linguistic analysis are written discourse and oral narratives rather than spoken discourse. The results and transcriptions will help applied linguists and L2 educators develop more effective materials for teaching Mandarin Chinese, a critical language designated by the U.S. government. The project database will enhance the infrastructure for language-related research and education, and will contribute to the training of students.  \n\nThis dissertation project recognizes the methodological limitations in previous text-based analyses and investigates how the distal demonstrative na 'that' is used in Mandarin Chinese everyday conversation from a discourse-pragmatic perspective. Apart from its canonical usage as a distal demonstrative, na has various kinds of extended and nuanced discourse functions. This project sets out to identify and classify different uses of na, with a special focus on its previously overlooked non-referential discourse pragmatic functions. More specifically, it will uncover sequential contexts, functional accounts, and positions of na using both a quantitative approach and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to offer a systematic analysis that accounts for all the occurrences and functions of na by speakers in actual everyday conversation. The secondary goal is to shed light on a better understanding of robust similarities and subtle language specific variations in the grammaticalization and/or pragmaticalization of demonstratives, particularly the non-deictic uses of pragmatic markers derived from demonstratives.

This project will capture data and knowledge from the last generation of Tanana and Gwich'in Athabascan elders who were raised in tribal communities largely untouched by Western colonization.  This generation, now in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, are taking key knowledge and data sets with them as they die, leaving subsequent generations impacted by this loss of knowledge. \n\nThe project will document Indigenous Knowledge of resilience through a qualitative phenomenology framework in using semi-structured interviews conducted by community researchers with Indigenous elders of the Central and Upper Yukon Basin, born between the years 1920 and 1950. Primary research questions are:\n-\tHow have adaptation strategies changed over a lifetime?\n-\tHow did environmental changes trigger changes in community social structure?\n-\tWhat lessons about resilience can be learned from the generation that bridged the gap between largely traditional Athabascan lifestyle and Anglo-European colonization?\nInterviews will be conducted with up to six Elders from the central Yukon Athabascan region - a remote area that was one of the last areas in Alaska to experience colonization. This project is urgent as the Elders who are the subjects of this research project are near end of life with three of the original Elders identified for this project having passed away during the previous two years. Additionally, a rural, Alaskan Native person will be trained in the project methodology and taught to harness the tools of science in the preservation of culture. Products include a plain language report that will be geared toward Native Alaskans, and the collected information and data will be made available via a public repository for other Native Alaskans and scientific researchers.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The damage from this tornado was concentrated in older low-income neighborhoods with many uninsured houses, limited government assistance, and low capacity to provide replacement housing within the community. This research examines recovery needs resulting from social vulnerability especially tenure and immigration. The results will assist planners, emergency managers, and policymakers to incorporate approaches within recovery programs that better communicate assistance eligibility criteria with immigrants. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to assist recovery of our most vulnerable populations after a disaster.\n\nThis research addresses gaps in the disaster literature with respect to low attention disasters that affect immigrants, renters and contract homeowners. Vulnerable households like immigrants and non-homeowners are at a disadvantage for accessing recovery assistance to complete home repairs and subsequently at a higher risk of long-term displacement. This project collects data to examine recovery experiences of immigrants and non-homeowners in the aftermath of the Marshalltown tornado that did not receive much attention and resources despite causing major damages in low income neighborhoods with a relatively higher percentage of minority, immigrant, and non-homeowner households. Hence, it offers a unique possibility for assessing the complex recovery challenges related to housing tenure and immigration after low attention disasters. Methods of data collection consist of conducting focus groups with households, one on one interviews, and participant observation. Analysis methods include qualitative coding of data through theme identification and constant comparison.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The US Gulf Coast region is especially vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes, sea level rise, land subsidence, and flooding. Some parishes in Louisiana have lost over 90% of their land, largely due to environmental changes. What socioeconomic and cultural factors influence perceptions of environment risk and migration? This project investigates factors not traditionally associated with the environment, including ties to place, strong social relationships, and counter perceptions of environmental risk, that might keep people in place, despite environmental risk. Migration theory suggests that behavior is largely linked to economic factors, such as income opportunities or life ambitions. This research, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, will investigate whether, and to what extent, environmental perceptions impact movement decisions. Improved understanding of movement decisions can inform local and state decision makers, yielding more precise composite descriptions of their constituents and likely behavioral outcomes, enabling better prediction of migration patterns and strategic planning. Environmental perceptions are also of value to the emergency and first-response communities when they confront new environmental dangers. The ability to better communicate environmental risk or danger can ultimately help to save lives.\n\nCharlotte Till, under the supervision of Dr. Shauna BurnSilver of Arizona State University, will explore the relationship between risk perceptions and migration decisions. This research will be conducted in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, an ideal setting for studying risk where there are both acute and chronic stressors on movement behavior. Hurricanes pose a severe seasonal threat to this area, but sea level rise and land subsidence represent cumulative risks and a new everyday reality for coastal people. During pilot study work in the area in 2016 the researchers found that relative to younger residents, older residents had less intention to leave despite known risks, and factors such as home, family, or community were important features of the environment. Based on survey and interview methodologies this research will first identify how the environment is perceived, and then investigate the influence of these perceptions on movement decisions. Survey responses will form the baseline data representing local perceptions, and then a subset of respondents will be invited to interviews allowing the investigator to explore movement logic(s) and the significance of identified influence factors for their decision making. Text analysis tools will be used to analyze interview data. Examples of the insights possible through the findings of this work include: how movement decisions are made, what factors result in place attachment outweighing risk, and how environmental factors interact with movement decisions. By actively incorporating individuals who do not move, this project is targeting an understudied but critical group for analyzing human movement patterns. By drawing participants directly from the parish this research may spur greater public engagement with science, contributing toward greater public scientific literacy. This research contributes to development of the migration literature on the role of the environment in movement decisions and factors impacting those decisions. This project will also facilitate improved understanding and engagement among communities, emergency managers, and municipal respresentatives.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make walking both safer and easier for transfemoral amputees. Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Gender equality is recognized as an important factor in catalyzing development and lifting communities out of poverty. Empowered women contribute to healthy and productive families, communities, and nations. An important step in doing this is to integrate high quality and timely gender analysis (examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and opportunities affect men, women, girls and boys in specific contexts), into decision-making and project planning. For both public and private sectors, early, action-oriented gender analysis is vital to tackle improve outcomes. In 2015 - 2016, OECD aid agencies spent, on average, $41.7 billion per year targeting gender equality and women's empowerment. Conservatively estimating that 3-5% of this expenditure is for gender analysis and action planning, that makes a market of $1.3-2.1 billion in the development sector alone. This project can potentially improve outcomes from that development funding.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a web-based application that automates the currently manual process of conducting gender analyses. This addresses a real world challenge faced by aid organizations to effectively integrate gender analyses into planning to inform effective and timely decision-making. Despite being a requirement by many organizations, there are procurement and contract delays, shortage of gender experts, and manual research and data collection.  This project will develop a machine learning model that leverages big data, APIs, and text-mining, driven by an analytic framework created by experts, to automate this process and deliver customized results instantly for a fraction of the cost. Phase I will build, train, and test the model for one sector and select countries. By the end of Phase I, the model will be tested and iterated to meet high quality control standards. Once validated, it will be ready to scale globally across sectors.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.\n\nA two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment. Finally, the workshop will catalyze new research collaborations, projects, and funding proposals related to engineering practice. Workshop activities will incorporate discussions of missing voices and contexts in the literature to identify critical areas for future research that supports broadening participation. Anticipated outcomes include an editorial or position piece on the current state of research on engineering education and actionable guidelines for future research, an edited volume or special issue of a journal comprised of papers or commentaries on engineering education and practice, and a workshop summary report. A special session during the 2018 FIE conference is also planned, to share highlights from the workshop, provide preliminary guidance on methods and approaches for research on engineering practice, and further grow the community of interest among a larger number of potential participants.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.\n\n\nThe core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Advances in transportation systems, fueled by on-demand mobility-platforms, crowd-sourcing, ride-hailing and increasing automation, promise to enhance the livability and competitiveness of cities and rural areas globally. A fundamental question is whether these innovations will contribute to solving, or inadvertently exacerbate, critical challenges such as congestion, emissions and inequitable access to mobility. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) research addresses a gap in current approaches by integrating quantitative and qualitative multi-disciplinary insights and developing methods to study how society adapts to evolving mobility technologies. Integrating insights from the social sciences in existing passenger and logistics system models will help understand how adoption behaviors are affected by diverse community beliefs and culture in rapidly changing mobility contexts. This research will have far-reaching effects, delivering new tools to tailor transformative mobility solutions to citizens' needs, decongest urban networks and expand mobility to underserved communities. The project includes educational efforts where students evaluate engineering solutions that align with human behavior and livability goals. The project will also develop online educational material and training tools for Chicago high school teachers, to promote careers in engineering in diverse communities. \n\nThe goal of this project is to establish a new foundation and develop methods to better understand and predict impacts of emerging freight and passenger mobility adoption. Specifically, this research establishes an analytical community mobility adoption framework that integrates current quantitative theory, data and methods (i.e. formal surveys, discrete choice analysis and supervised learning) with qualitative social science perspectives (theory of social thresholds, ethnographic data on neighborhood-scale mobility behavior). Robust policy guidance tools derived through combining qualitative, participatory, multi-stakeholder research methods and formal policy scenario simulation are expected to inform communities' transition resulting from the potentially disruptive socio-technical changes in transportation mobility choices. The impact will be strengthened by integration with education and outreach approaches that inspire, challenge and educate future civil engineers to address mobility challenges with technically informed and culturally sensitive designs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Findings from this research are used to develop training materials and inform a networking event intended to pair engineering faculty interested in engineering education research with potential mentors at different institutions.  Training engineering faculty in engineering education research expands the number of faculty adopting research-based instructional practices in their courses, and results in improved teaching, advising, programming, and policy-making by closing the research-to-practice gap.\n\nWhile previous mentorship models have focused on the content of engineering education as a field, this work identifies effective strategies from successful mentoring relationships that incorporate the social and cultural components of becoming an engineering education researcher. By conducting qualitative interviews of engineering faculty and engineering education researchers mentee-mentor pairs, the study the study develops a conceptual model of the formation of engineering education researchers' identity. This model clarifies how researchers undergo a paradigm shift and potential career pivot to expand their expertise in a related, but distinct, discipline of engineering education. This novel approach provides important information to enhance existing training materials and to develop additional training opportunities for engineering faculty who are interested in conducting engineering education research. Additionally, the model has implications for understanding job retraining and approaches for engaging faculty in lifelong learning.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Criminal courts that operate under the same formal law and policy often develop their own norms and practices, resulting in very different kinds of justice outcomes depending upon where a case is adjudicated. And when formal legal policies change, the reforms generally get implemented in distinct and divergent ways by local court actors, sometimes in ways inconsistent with policy goals. This project capitalizes upon recent major policy changes imposed in the federal criminal system by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to examine how different court \"communities\" have responded to the changes. Specifically, new policies have been developed urging prosecutors to focus on certain kinds of federal crimes, and that require prosecutors across the country to maximize the potential punishment. While the DOJ policies aim for standardized prosecutorial practices across the diverse federal district courts, prior research suggests that local courts will vary in how they translate these directives into action.  \n \nThe study builds directly upon the PI's previous NSF-funded research that examined jurisdictional differences in adjudication strategies in federal court, using both qualitative field methods and quantitative methods. The project revisits the same research sites (4 geographically and demographically diverse federal districts) to assess whether and how the current DOJ policy impacts caseload characteristics (including defendant demography) and adjudication practices and outcomes, with a focus on how formal top-down policy is translated into localized, on-the-ground legal action. Using interviews, observations, and administrative data from the federal courts, the project tests three related hypotheses: 1) Despite the return to policies that aim to control local practices through top-down mandates, adaptations will be localized in practice. Between-district variations will continue to be evident in four distinct sets of practices: case selection; prosecutorial charging practices; terms and modes of plea agreements; and formal sentencing practices. 2) Within-district, demographic composition of the caseload, the application of prosecutorial-controlled sentencing tools, and sentence lengths will change as a function of temporal period, but local adjudication norms will temper such change. 3) The degree of change in local practice norms will be greater in the current policy period (beginning May, 2017) than the previous one (2010-2017) because the current policy authorizes increased punishment for defendants and includes local compliance mechanisms.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite these frequent attributions, there is scant empirical evidence about how people view the role of luck in their lives, and how these views vary across the population. This proposal will analyze how people define luck, their views about the influence of luck on individual outcomes, and the aspects of their lives, e.g., financial success, job status, health, personal relationships, to which they apply luck. A critical component of the research will evaluate the extent to which people attribute socioeconomic outcomes to luck as compared with individual talents and effort. A better understanding of these perceptions will shed new light on views about social inequality, the factors that lead to success and failure, and individual motivations. These findings will provide new information to help individuals in society reflect upon the relative roles of luck, talent, and effort as reasons for their own outcomes as well as the outcomes for others in society.    \n \n \nThis proposal will conduct in-depth, open-ended interviews with a broadly representative national sample of 100 U.S. adults. Data will include age, socioeconomic status, race, military experience, health history, political affiliation, and gender. Data analysis will be conducted using ATLAS.ti. Following the general principles of grounded theory and abductive analysis, all interviews will be coded for primary patterns of response identifying general themes and key variations among participant groups. These findings will lay the foundation for a better understanding of how people view the determinants of success in their own life trajectories as well as for others.

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship provides an emerging scholar-scientist with an opportunity to investigate the ways in which diverse Black families navigate the racial socialization of their youth in the 21st century. The well-being of Black children in the United States is a matter of grave public health significance. The unfortunate realities of Ferguson, MI, Baltimore, MD, Sanford, FL, Charleston, SC, McKinney, TX, Cleveland, OH, and Chicago, IL, have left many in our society with questions about how to provide youth with the triumvirate \"affection, protection, and correction\"  required to optimize their psychosocial wellbeing. Racial socialization (RS) is a process that has been associated with a number of positive outcomes. However, this research has largely assessed Black mothers (of mother-father households), has predominately used survey data, and has focused on retrospective reporting of RS, limiting our conceptual understanding of a crucial parenting practice. This project addresses these limitations, expanding the study of RS in a number of important ways.\n\nThe project, entitled the \"Black Family Racial Socialization Project\" focuses on the development of three studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods, from the perspective of both parents and youth. The primary aim of the first study is to use survey and interview methods to elucidate the ways in which Black families representing a diverse structural spectrum (e.g., extended kin, blended families, LGBT couples) prepare themselves to undertake the RS of their children. The primary aim of the second study is to capture the synergistic and bidirectional nature of RS \"in the moment\", by using media (e.g., TV scenes, song lyrics, social media posts) to create and code ecologically-valid, family-level racial socialization conversations. The primary aim of the third study is to prospectively assess how Black parents and Black parents-to-be anticipate teaching their children about race \"in the future\". This study will utilize annual interviews and biannual surveys to monitor how intentions to socialize Black youth (and actual socialization behaviors) change over time, and to elucidate the principal factors that instigate such changes. Together, this research will lead to the development of a more complete conceptual framework that can be tested and instituted in future investigations. In addition, the findings from this research are expected to contribute to the development of effective interventions for Black families.",

              "abstractText" : "With Big Data comes the need for succinct data summaries that are easy to visualize and understand. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a particular suite of computational tools for summarizing and visualizing shape in high-dimensional data sets. These tools have been used in recent years to guide new discoveries in cancer research, neuroscience, materials science, image analysis, and many areas where shape, broadly construed, is of importance. However, by summarizing data in a succinct way certain important differences between data sets can often go undetected. This project provides a new mathematical framework for precisely measuring how lossy the most popular methods in TDA are. By developing new ways for quantifying how large-scale differences go undetected, the project offers enrichments of current topological methods to obtain novel data science tools with greater distinguishing power. The awarded funds will go primarily to fund a graduate student to aid the PI in basic research and development of these enriched topological summaries. Computational experiments on data sets of public interest, e.g. time-varying socio-economic indicators and weather data, will be carried out to test performance of these tools against current state of the art methods. Additionally, the PI will incorporate these novel methods into the data science curriculum at the PI's host institution and recruit students from historically under-represented groups to be trained as the nation's next generation of data scientists.\n\nThis project is an ambitious extension of earlier work undertaken by the PI and provides a targeted attack on the inverse problem for the main objects of study in topological data analysis: the merge tree, which tracks how connected components of the sub-level set of a function evolves; Reeb graphs, which tracks connected components of the fiber of a function; and the barcode/persistence diagram, which is a collection of intervals/points in the plane that represent an algorithmic pairing of critical points of a function on a space. The PI showed in earlier work how merge trees determine the associated barcode and provided a precise enumeration of how many distinct merge trees have the same barcode. By identifying functions on the real line that are related by an orientation preserving coordinate transformation, the PI showed how a novel enrichment of the merge tree---the chiral merge tree---faithfully captures these equivalence classes of functions and offers exponential distinguishing power over the barcode for time-series analysis. This project aims to carry out similar analysis for functions on surfaces, with an eye toward improving the classification performance of persistent homology in image analysis, and for Reeb graphs, to better integrate with level-set persistent homology. By carrying out a careful study of inverse problems in each of these settings, novel enrichments analogous to the chiral merge tree will be developed. Additionally, to make these enriched topological summaries useful for data classification tasks, novel metrics will be defined for comparing each of these summaries and algorithms will be developed for the efficient computation of these metrics.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "In some societies, traditional marriage customs may produce brides and grooms under the age of 18. International development groups refer to these as \"child marriages\" and consider them to be damaging to well-being, particularly for girls. Therefore, with wide support from Western nations, including the United States, significant resources are invested in campaigns to eradicate these practices. However, this movement has also been critiqued for relying on a notion that there is a clear and absolute boundary between childhood and adulthood that lies at 18 years. In fact, there is surprisingly little objective information available about why \"child marriage\" remains prevalent in some places despite its purported harmful consequences. The research supported by this award will address this question. Results from the project will support policy recommendations, and contribute to a wider critical engagement with the notion that early transitions to adulthood are necessarily harmful in all circumstances. \n\nResearch will be carried out in north western Tanzania among a Sukuma population where around one-third of girls marry before 18 years. Data collection will take place within a demographic surveillance site managed by the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research. Taking a mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected over a two-year period. To build an understanding of early marriage grounded in ethnographic reality, rather than stereotype, the project will first utilize focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify perceived risks to wellbeing that characterize female adolescence and the role of early marriage in elevating or mitigating such risk. Multiple dimensions of female wellbeing (physical and mental health, education, food security, empowerment, and community respect) will then be assessed via a large quantitative survey, and analyzed to determine if 18 years emerges as a meaningful threshold demarcating harmful marriage, or whether alternative age categorizations, if any, better predict variation in wellbeing. Quantitative and qualitative data will then be used test the hypotheses that early marriage is either the product of parental coercion and a parent-offspring conflict of interests, or whether it is better understood as a parental strategy to enhance the success of daughters. Finally, the project will quantify associations between age at menarche, first reproduction and marriage to explore hypothesized links between physiological and behavioral transitions into adulthood. The project includes the mentorship of an American Postdoctoral Scholar, research experience opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and capacity building for longer-term international collaborative research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Participants will receive coaching to prepare for graduate school and professional development, and they will be mentored into becoming independent creative thinkers and researchers. Participants will gain experience in scientific dissemination and communication, including publishing in professional conferences and journals, and giving scientific presentations.\n\nLong range HF communications work by the reflection of radio waves by the ionosphere layer of the atmosphere. These communications can travel around curvature of the earth, and work without the need for significant infrastructure like satellites, cellular networks, internet, etc. The challenge with HF communications is that propagation via the ionosphere may be unreliable, the ionospheric conditions may change very rapidly, and different frequencies have different propagation characteristics via the ionosphere. Successful communication depends on the time of day, location of users, selection of frequency, modulation, antenna type, and power level.  This project will generate new solutions to key problems that will enable more dependable and efficient long range HF communications. Specifically this project will investigate and develop: (i) New designs for spectrum agile radios for high frequency communications that can switch communication parameters such as modulation, coding, pulse shape, equalizer, power, etc.; (ii) Machine learning algorithms that can learn the best communication parameters for changing channel conditions; (iii) Low profile antennas that can be used in HF communications; (iv) Software and algorithms to predict network level connections that are possible ahead of time; (v) Qualitative and quantitative Ionospheric communications models; (vi) Flexible and automatic antenna tuning circuits; and (vii) Smart algorithms that can learn from their past experiences in varying Ionospheric conditions, weather situations, time and location.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Yet, it is still not clear how the many underlying chemical, physical, and biological processes interact to damage the kidneys during diabetes. It is challenging to monitor the damage to the kidneys inside a patient. The regions of the kidney that are damaged are very small and are deep within the body. It takes a long time for irreversible damage to accumulate to the point where non-invasive urine samples contain detectable quantities of proteins that leaked through the kidneys. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will connect several processes that have been shown individually to contribute to injury in kidneys due to diabetes into a sophisticated computer simulation. This computational tool will aid in understanding how the processes interact and how diabetic kidney damage begins and changes over time. In the long-term, results from this project will help to predict the impacts of many competing factors on kidney health during diabetes management. The computer simulation produced in the project can also be used to test and optimize treatments to slow the progression of DKD. The project also will involve a set of educational activities related to the scientific work. Several undergraduate and graduate students including women and underrepresented minorities will work with the PI to conduct the research and educational activities. Educational modules related to the research will be delivered to a variety of groups including K-12 students, college students, and grandparents. Physical models of kidney tissues will be 3D-printed and shared with students and educators. The activities will expose many students and members of the public to biomedical engineering and computational science through engaging scientific demonstrations and interactive experiences.\n\nThe principal investigator's long-term career goal is to develop multiscale computational models to enhance understanding of the mechanisms governing tissue remodeling and damage as a result of diseases and infections and to simulate the treatment of those conditions to improve human health.  Toward this goal, this project will develop a novel computational approach for studying diabetic kidney disease (DKD) through a virtual kidney that can be used like a powerful, non-invasive microscope to look into the body to detect and monitor damage to the glomeruli (where most damage occurs) during the onset and progression of diabetic complications in the kidney. The virtual kidney platform will use multiscale computational modeling to connect effects at different length scales from smaller to larger: inside cells, between adjacent cells, across a single glomerulus, and among collections of glomeruli interacting with other tissues in a kidney. A hybrid computational approach will take advantage of the benefits of stochastic differential equations to describe chemical species that react and interact in large quantities and of agent-based models to describe cells and chemical species that interact in small quantities or in qualitative up- or down-regulation fashions.  The Research Plan is organized under two aims.  The FIRST AIM is to formulate cellular level mathematical models of biochemical cell signaling networks responsible for damage in each of the three main glomerular zones: a) podocytes, b) mesangial cells and mesangial matrix and c) endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane.  Computational tools will be developed for importing biochemical networks, conducting uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, and validating model results for the three zones.  To assess validity, computational models will be compared to experimental evidence gleaned from the literature. The SECOND AIM is to build a virtual kidney computational model focusing on crosstalk, structural, and hemodynamic effects on the primary tissue compartments within multiple nephrons.  Steps include:  a) constructing a hybrid computational model for tissue level simulation of glomerular cells that combines information from reactions in single cells, connects multiple interacting cells and transports glucose and other molecules through the mesangium and the glomerular filtration barrier; b) connecting the glomerular models to a tubule and vessel centric-model for blood flow and filtration regulation and c) validating the virtual kidney model and simulating responses to stimuli.  A user-friendly interface will be created for specifying model input and stimuli, running the simulations, and visualizing results.  Simulations of the virtual kidney model will be rigorously compared to pharmacological, physiological, and histological data, primarily from humans.  After model validation to a subset of the data cases, in silico experiments will be conducted to predict the magnitudes and rates of change for glomerular injury outcomes including proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under DKD pathophysiological conditions.  The metric for success will be the accurate simulation of the classic trajectory of onset and progression of DKD subject to clinically relevant input and stimuli.  Computational tools and code developed will be distributed openly via GitHub repositories, which may be of broad interest to the systems biology research community using SBML and/or CompuCell3D.  In summary, the project addresses the critical need to compile the multiple mechanistic processes that contribute to DKD onset and progression into a user-friendly systematic framework capable of taking the interconnected chemical, physical, and biological factors into account in a coupled fashion and in the appropriate magnitudes and sequences to make testable predictions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The researcher will develop a comparative study of three cities: Belfast, Melbourne, and Bombay. She will focus on the microbe, the colonial administrator, and the bacteriologist as the central actors in each of the three cases. She will do so by engaging in a study of archival documents and other sources to obtain a deeper understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that make each region unique. She plans to show how specific features of the local environment in these three regions, when combined with plans of sanitary improvement and land use change espoused by the British Empire, served to produce unique environments in which particular microbes thrived. The proposed project draws from multiple disciplinary sources and is intended for multiple disciplinary audiences. The researcher plans to disseminate her research results at conferences and workshops sponsored by history departments, epidemiology and public health departments, public health policy centers, and organizations that engage in climate studies.\n\nThis project uses a historical frame while engaging with a number of central topics in the field of science and technology studies. It engages with the concept of nonhuman agency with its focus on the ecological specificity of microbes, and it uses Niche Construction Theory to access the localized environments and to draw out their relationship to microbial actors. Cultural construction of science and technology, particularly as it relates to imperialism and nineteenth century colonial practices, will also be an important element of consideration to this project. Using relatively new social scientific frameworks to guide this history, this project will engage with STS in its goal to induce new consideration of the agency of living objects and actor-network theory as a viable historical and social scientific frame.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The strategy will be to study a demonstrated successful learning model that integrates traditional high school STEM curriculum with real world projects from the STEM business community. The study will illuminate how the components of the program work together to support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers, in particular female and minority students. The findings of the study will make it possible to implement the program in similar contexts across the nation. A better understanding of experiential learning within a public school district context can potentially impact tens of thousands of students. \n\nThe goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory case study of Blue Valley Center for Advanced Professional Studies (BVCAPS) which is the founding location of the Center for Advanced Professional Studies (CAPS) network. CAPS will provide programming that includes STEM capstone experiences (in medicine, bioscience, technology, or engineering) for public school high school juniors and seniors. Guided by the theoretical and conceptual constructs of social cognitive career theory and high-quality project-based learning, this study will seek to answer the following research questions: 1) How does the CAPS model support students' motivation and preparation for STEM careers? 2) What aspects of the BVCAPS model contribute to increased female and under-represented minority student motivation and preparation for STEM careers? The qualitative exploration will be used to create a set of validated and reliable instruments that can be used to study this and similar programs more broadly as they relate to motivation and preparation for STEM careers. This study will build on the literature in high school STEM education in the area of project-based learning and capstone experiences in high school and add to the developing literature on high school STEM experiential learning. Measurement tools created by this study will enable examination of the capstone model in programs within the network of schools (over 10,000 students in more than 80 school districts within 13 states across the US) and more broadly. In addition to the potential impact of the measurement tools themselves, the findings of this study will address how other STEM educators can support the motivation and preparation for students in STEM careers, in particular female and minorities. Information gleaned in this area will help advance high school STEM reform and preparation for post-secondary careers and learning opportunities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Training engineering faculty in engineering education research expands the number of faculty adopting research-based instructional practices in their courses, and results in improved teaching, advising, programming, and policy-making by closing the research-to-practice gap.\n\nWhile previous mentorship models have focused on the content of engineering education as a field, this work identifies effective strategies from successful mentoring relationships that incorporate the social and cultural components of becoming an engineering education researcher. By conducting qualitative interviews of engineering faculty and engineering education researchers mentee-mentor pairs, the study the study develops a conceptual model of the formation of engineering education researchers' identity. This model clarifies how researchers undergo a paradigm shift and potential career pivot to expand their expertise in a related, but distinct, discipline of engineering education. This novel approach provides important information to enhance existing training materials and to develop additional training opportunities for engineering faculty who are interested in conducting engineering education research.

However, researchers in the history or sociology of science cannot study what is accepted and what is rejected in these journals because until recently they did not have access to a body of data that included accepted and rejected manuscripts, the topics covered, the characteristics of those who submitted manuscripts, and the comments of the reviewers.  Moreover, they did not have such data over time, so that they might see changes within a discipline in terms of topics and submitters.  The American Sociological Association (ASA) has electronic copies of all the manuscripts and all the reviews for ASA journals for a twenty-year period between 1991 and 2010.

Given the complexities of the Archive data file, CSSR will hold a two-day workshop so that interested scholars can be trained to use it to answer critical questions about the history and development of sociology in a time-period of pronounced changes in the discipline.  Faculty trained on the use of the archive will pass on this knowledge to their colleagues in sociology and other disciplines to further the study of the peer-review system for a flagship journal. This project is beneficial because it allows for scrutiny of the scientific process.\n\nThis project will support a two-day workshop to be held in April 2019 to train faculty and graduate students in the use of the ASA/Mason American Sociological Review (ASR) Digital Archive.

The Archive was created by examining all submitted manuscripts, matching them with reviewers, and using the internet to secure other information about authors and reviewers. This information was merged into four types of files, including author, reviewer, person, and manuscript information. Workshop participants will become familiar with the files and learn how to link them and/or how to use each separately, depending on the research question to be answered. Examining these files allows researchers to determine whether the peer networks of reviews are intellectually distant from those of authors, or whether both the author and the reviewer are in the same networks, thus suggesting the potential for reviewer bias.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project will  fill gaps in knowledge about the development of self-efficacy and engineering identity in low-income, academically talented students. The project will also identify the most effective combinations of curricular and co-curricular activities that strengthen individual students' self-efficacy and identity, with the goal of developing intervention techniques that retain engineering majors through graduation and placement in industry or graduate school. Quantitative measurable outcomes will include increased student retention, increased cohort self-efficacy and identity statistics, higher-than-average graduation rates for the cohorts using evidence-based programs, and successful placement in industry or graduate school.  Qualitative measurable outcomes, determined by participant interviews and surveys, will include attainment of academic and personal goals, increased leadership skills and confidence levels, and established sense of community.

In order to encourage female leaders, many companies leverage diversity training initiatives or women-centered solutions, such as women's networking groups or leadership training. While these solutions have merits, they often place the burden of creating more gender inclusive organizations on women themselves. A more effective approach to enhance gender inclusivity is to understand the role that male leaders may play in supporting women's advancement within organizations. While many male leaders may understand the importance of supporting female leaders, they may not know how to effectively do so. This proposal seeks to identify effective behaviors of male champions for female leadership and for supporting gender equality in organizations. This research highlights ways in which males can contribute to gender inclusivity at work. Results from this project can inform organizations about how to influence, train, and encourage possible male champions to actively support female leadership in the workplace. \n\nMale champions, or male leaders who value diversity in the workplace and support advancing talented females to leader positions, have a critical role to play as agents of change to enhance gender equality. The purpose of this project is to identify the effective behaviors of male champions. Multiple studies that utilize different research designs and methods will be conducted to examine these behaviors. First, we will conduct a qualitative study, which utilizes interviews with male champions and those who have been supported by male champions, to determine key gender inclusive leadership behaviors. Themes derived from the interviews will be used to generate a quantitative measure of gender inclusive behaviors among male leaders. Second, we will conduct a quantitative study to examine the relationship between gender inclusive leader behaviors and workplace outcomes. Effects of top-level leaders' gender inclusive behaviors on their direct reports attitudes and performance will be examined using multi-source, multi-level data. Finally, we will conduct an in-depth case study of a best practices company for gender inclusive leadership. This study will utilize observational data and in-depth interviews with high level leaders and their direct reports to better understand the processes through which male champion behaviors create gender inclusive workplace cultures. Results of this research can benefit workers and their organizations by enhancing our understanding of factors contributing to gender equality in organizations.",

In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.\n\nThis project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Fundamentally new approaches that are designed specifically to address the challenges of limited-resource settings are needed. Utilizing paper as a substrate to develop biosensors is attractive because the resources required to produce them are minimal and the materials are ubiquitous and inexpensive.  This project will create new device designs that can enable paper-based biosensing.  Hydrophilic (wettable) channels will be patterned in paper using hydrophobic (non-wettable) barriers in order to control the transport of sample fluids by wicking.   In addition to devising a new strategy for bioanalysis in limited-resource settings, the broader impacts of this research program include the creation of educational opportunities for middle school students (hands-on workshops), high school students (device design challenges and summer internships), and science teachers (classroom kit development).\n\n\nDue to their low cost and ease of use, paper-based microfluidic devices have gained attention as a platform to develop point-of-use bioassays. Independent of the advances in assay development, the paper-based devices themselves, in spite of their vast potential to facilitate bioanalysis, have received surprisingly little attention. This project aims to build an integrated research and education program centered on developing novel paper-based microfluidic devices that can facilitate biosensing based on chemical and biochemical reactions that occur at the interfaces formed between converging liquid fronts. Devices exploiting this approach will facilitate multiplexed biosensing using assay formats that are traditionally considered to be incompatible with flow-based devices (e.g., chemical reactions). The central hypothesis of this research is that the material properties of the paper (e.g., porosity) and the transport of reaction products (e.g., by diffusion) will ultimately control the analytical performance of these paper-based biosensors. By studying these variables systematically, new strategies for low-cost, paper-based biosensing will be developed. Assays at fluidic interfaces will result in the formation of visible colors that will allow users to easily interpret the results of an assay via visual threshold (qualitative), visual comparisons of intensities to read guides (semi-quantitative), or with image analysis (quantitative). This research is significant because the devices derived from this program span a broad range of applications in bioanalysis and will serve as versatile tools for all forms of analytical chemistry. Potential applications include: (i) environmental monitoring of heavy metals, (ii) food security and nutrient density, (iii) detection of nucleic acids and proteins, and (iv) the development of diagnostic assays that are designed specifically for use in limited-resource settings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These words (e.g. this and that), known in linguistics as demonstratives, are typically used to focus the hearer's attention on entities in the speech situation. Over time, some of these words evolve and may develop various kinds of new functions such as connectives and hesitation signals. Despite the universality of demonstratives across languages, demonstratives differ in how they change and why they evolve in certain ways. Although demonstratives have long been a key research topic in linguistics, we know surprisingly little about how demonstratives and demonstrative-derived pragmatic markers are used in spontaneous face-to-face conversation. This is due to the fact that the most commonly used genres in linguistic analysis are written discourse and oral narratives rather than spoken discourse. The results and transcriptions will help applied linguists and L2 educators develop more effective materials for teaching Mandarin Chinese, a critical language designated by the U.S. government. The project database will enhance the infrastructure for language-related research and education, and will contribute to the training of students.  \n\nThis dissertation project recognizes the methodological limitations in previous text-based analyses and investigates how the distal demonstrative na 'that' is used in Mandarin Chinese everyday conversation from a discourse-pragmatic perspective. Apart from its canonical usage as a distal demonstrative, na has various kinds of extended and nuanced discourse functions. This project sets out to identify and classify different uses of na, with a special focus on its previously overlooked non-referential discourse pragmatic functions. More specifically, it will uncover sequential contexts, functional accounts, and positions of na using both a quantitative approach and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to offer a systematic analysis that accounts for all the occurrences and functions of na by speakers in actual everyday conversation. The secondary goal is to shed light on a better understanding of robust similarities and subtle language specific variations in the grammaticalization and/or pragmaticalization of demonstratives, particularly the non-deictic uses of pragmatic markers derived from demonstratives. This dissertation project will contribute to a deeper understanding of a common human language phenomenon with fresh data and from an interactional perspective.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The damage from this tornado was concentrated in older low-income neighborhoods with many uninsured houses, limited government assistance, and low capacity to provide replacement housing within the community. This research examines recovery needs resulting from social vulnerability especially tenure and immigration. The results will assist planners, emergency managers, and policymakers to incorporate approaches within recovery programs that better communicate assistance eligibility criteria with immigrants. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to assist recovery of our most vulnerable populations after a disaster.\n\nThis research addresses gaps in the disaster literature with respect to low attention disasters that affect immigrants, renters and contract homeowners. Vulnerable households like immigrants and non-homeowners are at a disadvantage for accessing recovery assistance to complete home repairs and subsequently at a higher risk of long-term displacement. This project collects data to examine recovery experiences of immigrants and non-homeowners in the aftermath of the Marshalltown tornado that did not receive much attention and resources despite causing major damages in low income neighborhoods with a relatively higher percentage of minority, immigrant, and non-homeowner households. Hence, it offers a unique possibility for assessing the complex recovery challenges related to housing tenure and immigration after low attention disasters. Methods of data collection consist of conducting focus groups with households, one on one interviews, and participant observation.

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\n\nFor the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Garden State LSAMP (GSLSAMP) program was established in 2009 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of New Jersey.  The eight public and private institutions that make up the GSLSAMP are diverse and include one community college and seven four-year institutions, including one private institution.  The institutions are Essex County College, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University New Brunswick and Newark, and William Paterson University.  The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) graduates with STEM degrees by 60% over the next five years.  This goal will be accomplished by integrating GSLSAMP efforts and proven best practices into institutional, local and regional efforts that encourage success in STEM including learning communities, research experiences, academic bootcamps, collaboration with the community colleges of the Northern New Jersey Bridges to the Baccalaureate, research conferences and advisement. It will also increase the number of urban minority students from GSLSAMP institutions pursuing graduate education and international experiences by 20% through integrated research experiences and graduate school preparation and advisement.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"\n\nThe knowledge generating research study seeks to understand the factors and mechanisms related to the GSLSAMP's successes in increasing the participation of URM students in STEM from several common and uncommon sources and their subsequent graduation with an undergraduate STEM degree.  The studies will potentially reveal the factors and mechanisms in the STEM academic pipeline that increase URM students' interests and efforts in pursuing graduate training and a career in STEM, which will lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.  An external evaluation team will implement both quantitative and qualitative instruments to assess the overall quality of the programs on the individual campuses as well as the entire alliance related to the overall goals of the project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\n\nSRI International (SRI) in partnership with Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall) will conduct an efficacy study of a new comprehensive science curriculum for middle grades 6-8 called Amplify Science Middle School (ASMS). This school science curriculum integrates disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. The overarching aim of the study will be to understand the impact of the curriculum on student achievement, classroom implementation, and teacher practice in relation to the recommendations of \"A Framework for K-12 Science Education\" and the Next Generation of Science Standards. While the number of states fully adopting NGSS hovers at around 20, nearly another 20 states have either incorporated the Framework or substantial portions of the NGSS into their state frameworks. Currently, the number of curriculum materials that have been designed for the Framework are relatively few, and thus the efficacy evidence basis for NGSS-designed curricula is limited. As more and more curriculum materials become available for supporting the Framework vision, the science education field needs rigorous research on the efficacy of curricula and the conditions required to implement them. ASMS is the Hall's first comprehensive 6-8 grade curriculum that has been designed specifically to meet the vision of the Framework and NGSS. Field trials of ASMS with more than 475 teachers and 34,000 students in a wide variety of settings, including urban, rural and suburban schools, have shown positive impact on student achievement, providing a compelling reason for a large-scale efficacy trial at this time.\n\nThe study will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods within an experimental design that will allow the examination of relations between contextual factors and student learning gains to help explain the results. Thus, this study will be important for moving education researchers toward increased understanding of how to meaningfully study and support teaching and learning in districts that will be trying to implement the next generation of science curriculum materials. Work will be conducted in districts with large numbers of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields so that educators can better understand the promise of NGSS-aligned curricula in promoting access and equity in science education. The research team will conduct a random assignment efficacy study in 7th grade classrooms beginning in academic year 2018-19 and following up with these students as 8th graders in academic year 2019-20. Teachers in both conditions will receive professional development on the NGSS; teachers in the treatment condition will also receive professional development in the use of the ASMS materials. The recruiting target is a sample of 48 middle schools within up to 6 medium to large districts in California and/or Washington. The researchers will attempt to recruit all middle schools and all 7th grade\nscience teachers in a district. It is anticipated that each school will have an average of two teachers teaching 3 sections of 7th grade science with 30 students per section for an approximate total of 96 teachers and 8,640 students. All students should have opportunities to learn science. This study will aim to draw valid inferences about the impact of curricula in districts with high concentrations of students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. This work will also contribute to the larger, nationwide effort to support standards-based instructional reforms in science by helping to identify conditions needed for successful implementation of NGSS-designed curriculum materials. The findings will provide an important basis for investments in new curriculum materials and will be of strong interest to those in science education and the learning sciences, as well as to district leaders and policymakers concerned with scaling up of rigorous curriculum.",

              "abstractText" : "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to enhance listening comprehension skills via an innovative interactive learning platform that aligns with Common Core State Standards for listening comprehension and uses best practices in game-based learning. In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.\n\nThis project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "All languages have words to indicate entities that are being referred to. These words (e.g. this and that), known in linguistics as demonstratives, are typically used to focus the hearer's attention on entities in the speech situation. Over time, some of these words evolve and may develop various kinds of new functions such as connectives and hesitation signals. Despite the universality of demonstratives across languages, demonstratives differ in how they change and why they evolve in certain ways. Although demonstratives have long been a key research topic in linguistics, we know surprisingly little about how demonstratives and demonstrative-derived pragmatic markers are used in spontaneous face-to-face conversation. This is due to the fact that the most commonly used genres in linguistic analysis are written discourse and oral narratives rather than spoken discourse. The results and transcriptions will help applied linguists and L2 educators develop more effective materials for teaching Mandarin Chinese, a critical language designated by the U.S. government. The project database will enhance the infrastructure for language-related research and education, and will contribute to the training of students.  \n\nThis dissertation project recognizes the methodological limitations in previous text-based analyses and investigates how the distal demonstrative na 'that' is used in Mandarin Chinese everyday conversation from a discourse-pragmatic perspective. Apart from its canonical usage as a distal demonstrative, na has various kinds of extended and nuanced discourse functions. This project sets out to identify and classify different uses of na, with a special focus on its previously overlooked non-referential discourse pragmatic functions. More specifically, it will uncover sequential contexts, functional accounts, and positions of na using both a quantitative approach and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to offer a systematic analysis that accounts for all the occurrences and functions of na by speakers in actual everyday conversation. The secondary goal is to shed light on a better understanding of robust similarities and subtle language specific variations in the grammaticalization and/or pragmaticalization of demonstratives, particularly the non-deictic uses of pragmatic markers derived from demonstratives. This dissertation project will contribute to a deeper understanding of a common human language phenomenon with fresh data and from an interactional perspective.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project will capture data and knowledge from the last generation of Tanana and Gwich'in Athabascan elders who were raised in tribal communities largely untouched by Western colonization.  This generation, now in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, are taking key knowledge and data sets with them as they die, leaving subsequent generations impacted by this loss of knowledge. \n\nThe project will document Indigenous Knowledge of resilience through a qualitative phenomenology framework in using semi-structured interviews conducted by community researchers with Indigenous elders of the Central and Upper Yukon Basin, born between the years 1920 and 1950. Primary research questions are:\n-\tHow have adaptation strategies changed over a lifetime?\n-\tHow did environmental changes trigger changes in community social structure?\n-\tWhat lessons about resilience can be learned from the generation that bridged the gap between largely traditional Athabascan lifestyle and Anglo-European colonization?\nInterviews will be conducted with up to six Elders from the central Yukon Athabascan region - a remote area that was one of the last areas in Alaska to experience colonization. This project is urgent as the Elders who are the subjects of this research project are near end of life with three of the original Elders identified for this project having passed away during the previous two years. Additionally, a rural, Alaskan Native person will be trained in the project methodology and taught to harness the tools of science in the preservation of culture. Products include a plain language report that will be geared toward Native Alaskans, and the collected information and data will be made available via a public repository for other Native Alaskans and scientific researchers.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The damage from this tornado was concentrated in older low-income neighborhoods with many uninsured houses, limited government assistance, and low capacity to provide replacement housing within the community. This research examines recovery needs resulting from social vulnerability especially tenure and immigration. The results will assist planners, emergency managers, and policymakers to incorporate approaches within recovery programs that better communicate assistance eligibility criteria with immigrants. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to assist recovery of our most vulnerable populations after a disaster.\n\nThis research addresses gaps in the disaster literature with respect to low attention disasters that affect immigrants, renters and contract homeowners. Vulnerable households like immigrants and non-homeowners are at a disadvantage for accessing recovery assistance to complete home repairs and subsequently at a higher risk of long-term displacement. This project collects data to examine recovery experiences of immigrants and non-homeowners in the aftermath of the Marshalltown tornado that did not receive much attention and resources despite causing major damages in low income neighborhoods with a relatively higher percentage of minority, immigrant, and non-homeowner households. Hence, it offers a unique possibility for assessing the complex recovery challenges related to housing tenure and immigration after low attention disasters. Methods of data collection consist of conducting focus groups with households, one on one interviews, and participant observation. Analysis methods include qualitative coding of data through theme identification and constant comparison.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "Short-term environmental disturbances and long-term environmental change have displaced millions worldwide. The US Gulf Coast region is especially vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes, sea level rise, land subsidence, and flooding. Some parishes in Louisiana have lost over 90% of their land, largely due to environmental changes. What socioeconomic and cultural factors influence perceptions of environment risk and migration? This project investigates factors not traditionally associated with the environment, including ties to place, strong social relationships, and counter perceptions of environmental risk, that might keep people in place, despite environmental risk. Migration theory suggests that behavior is largely linked to economic factors, such as income opportunities or life ambitions. This research, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, will investigate whether, and to what extent, environmental perceptions impact movement decisions. Improved understanding of movement decisions can inform local and state decision makers, yielding more precise composite descriptions of their constituents and likely behavioral outcomes, enabling better prediction of migration patterns and strategic planning. Environmental perceptions are also of value to the emergency and first-response communities when they confront new environmental dangers. The ability to better communicate environmental risk or danger can ultimately help to save lives.\n\nCharlotte Till, under the supervision of Dr. Shauna BurnSilver of Arizona State University, will explore the relationship between risk perceptions and migration decisions. This research will be conducted in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, an ideal setting for studying risk where there are both acute and chronic stressors on movement behavior. Hurricanes pose a severe seasonal threat to this area, but sea level rise and land subsidence represent cumulative risks and a new everyday reality for coastal people. During pilot study work in the area in 2016 the researchers found that relative to younger residents, older residents had less intention to leave despite known risks, and factors such as home, family, or community were important features of the environment. Based on survey and interview methodologies this research will first identify how the environment is perceived, and then investigate the influence of these perceptions on movement decisions. Survey responses will form the baseline data representing local perceptions, and then a subset of respondents will be invited to interviews allowing the investigator to explore movement logic(s) and the significance of identified influence factors for their decision making. Text analysis tools will be used to analyze interview data. Examples of the insights possible through the findings of this work include: how movement decisions are made, what factors result in place attachment outweighing risk, and how environmental factors interact with movement decisions. By actively incorporating individuals who do not move, this project is targeting an understudied but critical group for analyzing human movement patterns. By drawing participants directly from the parish this research may spur greater public engagement with science, contributing toward greater public scientific literacy. This research contributes to development of the migration literature on the role of the environment in movement decisions and factors impacting those decisions. This project will also facilitate improved understanding and engagement among communities, emergency managers, and municipal respresentatives.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make walking both safer and easier for transfemoral amputees. Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Gender equality is recognized as an important factor in catalyzing development and lifting communities out of poverty. Empowered women contribute to healthy and productive families, communities, and nations. An important step in doing this is to integrate high quality and timely gender analysis (examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and opportunities affect men, women, girls and boys in specific contexts), into decision-making and project planning. For both public and private sectors, early, action-oriented gender analysis is vital to tackle improve outcomes. In 2015 - 2016, OECD aid agencies spent, on average, $41.7 billion per year targeting gender equality and women's empowerment. Conservatively estimating that 3-5% of this expenditure is for gender analysis and action planning, that makes a market of $1.3-2.1 billion in the development sector alone. This project can potentially improve outcomes from that development funding.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a web-based application that automates the currently manual process of conducting gender analyses. This addresses a real world challenge faced by aid organizations to effectively integrate gender analyses into planning to inform effective and timely decision-making. Despite being a requirement by many organizations, there are procurement and contract delays, shortage of gender experts, and manual research and data collection.  This project will develop a machine learning model that leverages big data, APIs, and text-mining, driven by an analytic framework created by experts, to automate this process and deliver customized results instantly for a fraction of the cost. Phase I will build, train, and test the model for one sector and select countries. By the end of Phase I, the model will be tested and iterated to meet high quality control standards. Once validated, it will be ready to scale globally across sectors.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "There has arguably never been a more exciting time to be an engineer. In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.\n\nA two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment. Finally, the workshop will catalyze new research collaborations, projects, and funding proposals related to engineering practice. Workshop activities will incorporate discussions of missing voices and contexts in the literature to identify critical areas for future research that supports broadening participation. Anticipated outcomes include an editorial or position piece on the current state of research on engineering education and actionable guidelines for future research, an edited volume or special issue of a journal comprised of papers or commentaries on engineering education and practice, and a workshop summary report. A special session during the 2018 FIE conference is also planned, to share highlights from the workshop, provide preliminary guidance on methods and approaches for research on engineering practice, and further grow the community of interest among a larger number of potential participants.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

              "abstractText" : "This SBIR Phase I project will produce a digital + physical game for 6-10 year olds that fosters computational thinking practices through collaboration, listening, and tinkering through play with music. It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.\n\n\nThe core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
