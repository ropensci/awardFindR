        focuses on violent conflict in protests, media and the politics of representation.
        It critically explores the idea of South Africa as a constitutional democracy

        I employ a comparative political science analysis that discusses democracy
        as a system of intellectual requirements that need to be fulfilled in order
        to function in a network society. \\nMy research traces the study of digital
        cultures and suggests a reallocation of power from government back to citizens
        in the nexus between the physical and digital space of protest. Furthermore,
        I interrogate whether there is a new socio-political framework that arises
        from this and whether this framework bases itself on the political structure
        of western democracy or whether South Africa has shifted into an autocratic
        state.\\n I explore the relationship between digital activism as a form of
        protest against political elites who use classification of information to
        conduct corrupt activities. I achieve this through a critical exploration

        worldwide are concerned with ensuring food security to their populations so
        as to achieve sustainable peace and security. To attain this, sustainable
        agriculture is advocated as a golden solution. Since its independence in 1961,
        Tanzania has committed to agriculture for the same rationale. However, this
        strategy has proved less effective to the ethnic minorities. Indeed, food
        insecurity has continued to cause peace instability to such communities. The
        Hadzabe community is a case in point. The government efforts have proved futile
        to the community. This raises an important research question, \\\"Why the
        government's food security interventions brought about unfavourable outcomes
        for both the policymakers and the communities?\\\" This study sets out to
        explain the reasons for the failure of government's food security interventions
        in the Hadzabe community. The study will employ a case-study research design.

        State Building and Political Stability: Reexamining the Ethiopian Experiment
        after 25 years\",\"project_description\":\"In this proposed research, I plan
        to build upon my earlier studies on federalism and conflict management in
        Ethiopia and re/assess the record of Ethiopian federalism in maintaining political
        stability. This study seeks to examine those factors that could help explain
        the current political stalemate and instability from three interrelated perspectives.
        \\nFirst, ethnicity and federal restructuringâ€“ unlike other federations,
        Ethiopia expressly empowers ethnicity. In other words, ethnicity is constitutionalised
        as the chief instrument of state organization in the federal and regional
        constitutions. Indeed, self-governance and autonomy in the Ethiopian federal
        system are premised on the matching of ethnic and politico- administrative
        boundaries. We contend in this study that rigorous ethnicisation of territory
        contributed to inter-ethnic tensions and conflicts. \\nSecond, federalism
        and political pluralism â€“ the study examines how the narrowing of political
        space continues to affect federalism's ability to emerge as a sustainable
        instrument of conflict management. Indeed, since the controversial 2005 elections,
        the ruling party undertook a series of legislative measures that greatly curtailed
        political pluralism in the country. Consequently, there is now no representation
        of opposition parties in the federal and regional parliaments. Nor are there
        vibrant civil society and media in the country. The lack of open and peaceful
        platform for political protestation and contestation, we contend in this study,
        led to violent protests. \\nThird, reforming Ethiopia's federalism â€“ the
        study contends that all federations are 'works in progress' and need to adjust
        themselves from time to time in order to respond to their legal and institutional
        deficits and in response to new challenges. In light of this, the study is
        going to consider legal/constitutional and institutional reforms that would
        be required to put the Ethiopian federal system on a sustainable trajectory.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"Addis

        study investigates on one hand the framing of issues and presentation of socio-religious
        discourses in Ugandan broadcasting media (radio and television), and the meanings
        constructed by audiences of these media outlets.  Specifically, this study
        focuses on the content of Ugandan Muslim television; Salaam TV and the four
        Muslim radio stations (i.e. Bilal FM, Voice of Africa FM, Pearl FM, and IUIU
        FM), and the meaning audiences construct in relation to national unity. Three
        strategic questions guide this study; 1) What informs the framing and packaging
        of Muslim Radio and Television Stations in Uganda? 2) How do Muslim Radio
        and Television Stations deal with social religious discourse prevailing in
        Uganda? 3) What kind of meaning audiences construct from broadcasted content
        by Ugandan Muslim radio and television stations? The study intends first to
        bridge the academic gap as for as the interdisciplinary study of religion
        and media is concerned in East Africa and Uganda, but most importantly, to
        examine Muslim electronic media and their role in shaping Muslim identity
        along religious lines. I want to show that religious media using religious

        focuses on violent conflict in protests, media and the politics of representation.
        It critically explores the idea of South Africa as a constitutional democracy
        and how free speech legislation at once promotes and inhibits access to information.
        I employ a comparative political science analysis that discusses democracy
        as a system of intellectual requirements that need to be fulfilled in order
        to function in a network society. \\nMy research traces the study of digital
        cultures and suggests a reallocation of power from government back to citizens
        in the nexus between the physical and digital space of protest. Furthermore,
        I interrogate whether there is a new socio-political framework that arises
        from this and whether this framework bases itself on the political structure
        of western democracy or whether South Africa has shifted into an autocratic
        state.\\n I explore the relationship between digital activism as a form of
        protest against political elites who use classification of information to
        conduct corrupt activities. I achieve this through a critical exploration
        of media reports, South African legislation on communicative freedom and free
        speech activist groups such as The Right 2 Know Campaign and the SOS Coalition.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"University

        worldwide are concerned with ensuring food security to their populations so
        as to achieve sustainable peace and security. To attain this, sustainable
        agriculture is advocated as a golden solution. Since its independence in 1961,
        Tanzania has committed to agriculture for the same rationale. However, this
        strategy has proved less effective to the ethnic minorities. Indeed, food
        insecurity has continued to cause peace instability to such communities. The
        Hadzabe community is a case in point. The government efforts have proved futile
        to the community. This raises an important research question, \\\"Why the
        government's food security interventions brought about unfavourable outcomes
        for both the policymakers and the communities?\\\" This study sets out to
        explain the reasons for the failure of government's food security interventions
        in the Hadzabe community. The study will employ a case-study research design.

        State Building and Political Stability: Reexamining the Ethiopian Experiment
        after 25 years\",\"project_description\":\"In this proposed research, I plan
        to build upon my earlier studies on federalism and conflict management in
        Ethiopia and re/assess the record of Ethiopian federalism in maintaining political
        stability. This study seeks to examine those factors that could help explain
        the current political stalemate and instability from three interrelated perspectives.
        \\nFirst, ethnicity and federal restructuringâ€“ unlike other federations,
        Ethiopia expressly empowers ethnicity. In other words, ethnicity is constitutionalised
        as the chief instrument of state organization in the federal and regional
        constitutions. Indeed, self-governance and autonomy in the Ethiopian federal
        system are premised on the matching of ethnic and politico- administrative
        boundaries. We contend in this study that rigorous ethnicisation of territory
        contributed to inter-ethnic tensions and conflicts. \\nSecond, federalism
        and political pluralism â€“ the study examines how the narrowing of political
        space continues to affect federalism's ability to emerge as a sustainable
        instrument of conflict management. Indeed, since the controversial 2005 elections,
        the ruling party undertook a series of legislative measures that greatly curtailed
        political pluralism in the country. Consequently, there is now no representation
        of opposition parties in the federal and regional parliaments. Nor are there
        vibrant civil society and media in the country. The lack of open and peaceful
        platform for political protestation and contestation, we contend in this study,
        led to violent protests. \\nThird, reforming Ethiopia's federalism â€“ the
        study contends that all federations are 'works in progress' and need to adjust
        themselves from time to time in order to respond to their legal and institutional
        deficits and in response to new challenges. In light of this, the study is
        going to consider legal/constitutional and institutional reforms that would
        be required to put the Ethiopian federal system on a sustainable trajectory.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"Addis

        Security and Landmines: Gendered Meaning-making and Materialities in the North-Eastern

        of how landmines continue to reshape social space, practices, identities and
        the security of people along gender lines in Mukumbura due to their co-existence
        with these objects every day more than three decades after the protracted
        war of liberation. Their everyday living experiences and narratives are symptomatic
        of life devoid of security, characteristically gendered and seemingly constrained
        in terms of social and physical space and practices. I employ the Feminist
        Posthuman Approach as my analytical framework to espouse the visibly gendered
        outlook characterizing the current realities and the subsequent epistemological
        discourse of peace and security in practice and theory as influenced by the
        'intra-actions'  of humans and objects respectively. My study seeks to explore
        this epistemological trajectory through the use of novel techniques of analysis
        in the form of a discursive-materialist analysis of the human-object entanglement,
        where landmines as objects possess a coercive effect in reconfiguring the
        everyday experiences and security of the people in Mukumbura in a post-conflict
        context. This dimension inclines to the Posthumanism or new materialities
        perspective which engender the object as unit of analysis/actor in human security
        and peace discourse in post-conflict contexts relative to the traditional
        realist notion of security-insecurity as a function of humans alone. I will
        insure the validity of my findings through use of more than one data collection
        tool. I will also probe further for clarity from my respondents.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"University

        Perils of Historiography: Another Culture of Violence in Northern Nigeria\",\"project_description\":\"Central
        to the recurring inter-communal conflicts between the\\nHausa-Fulani Muslims
        and non-Muslim ethnic minorities in northern Nigeria is the\\nproduction of
        narratives of victimhood and resistance. However, most\\nstudies of conflict
        in the region have only focused on social, economic,\\npolitical, religious
        and environmental factors, ignoring salient\\nhistoriographical/textual and
        discursive roots and processes of the\\nphenomenon. This project interrogates
        how\\nthe extra-textual meaning-assigning agency of historiography is\\nmanufactured
        and weaponized in conflict situations. As monster-making\\ntechnology, these
        narratives originally popularized by journalists gradually\\nsneaked into
        the academia, creating a dissident community of discourse â€“\\nacademic authors,
        activists, priests and publishers who together constructed\\na popular cultural
        resentment against the Hausa-Fulani Muslims. The\\nconsumers of these narratives
        are constantly reminded of the historical\\ninjuries of the 19th jihad wars
        in Hausa land and mobilized along the most\\ndreaded discursive idioms â€“
        \\\"Kaduna Mafia: the Killer Squad\\\", \\\"northern\\nminorities, why we
        fight them\\\", \\\"Hausa-Fulani violence\\\", and \\\"pastoral\\njihadism\\\",
        which featured regularly in both academic and popular discourse.\\nBetween
        1980 and 2016 more than 100 violent communal clashes â€“ in which\\nthousands
        of people including women and children lost their lives â€“ were\\nreported
        in the volatile Middle Belt areas of Jos, Benue and Southern Kaduna.\\nTo
        what extent do these historical discourses function as\\nincentive to violent
        clashes? Located within critical work that is attuned to the salience of knowledge-conflict
        nexus, the project seeks to demonstrate how historical narratives, animated
        by rumours and conspiracy theories, acquired functional discursive properties
        and social meaning. Preliminary reading of the conflicts suggests deep-seated

        in End-of-Life Care: Bioethics and Human Rights in Aging Societies\",\"project_description\":\"Aging
        Societies: The world population aged over 60 will outnumber children by 2020.
        All countries face major challenges to ensure preparedness in health and social
        systems. Japan is the most advanced aging society in the world (28 % of the
        aging rate), with great pressure on national finance, e.g., an increase of
        $6.6 million primarily targeting the older population for the 2019 budget.
        Japan is shifting from a hospital-base to home-base health care delivery to
        prepare for an estimated 1.6 million deaths/yr. from 2035. Such rapid demographic
        change threatens individuals, communities, society, and the country. The US
        (15 % of aging rate) will have 78 million people aged over 65, exceeding the
        number of children. Hospices (over 6,100) outnumbered hospitals (5,723). Medicare
        Part A covers end-of-life care is estimated to be depleted by 2030. \\n\\nWhat
        is Unknown: Justice in end-of-life is little studied in general. The end-of-life
        care experts' experiences with dying patients were not well aggregated. \\n\\nPurpose
        of the Research: I will examine how justice (through a bioethics and human
        rights-based approach) may improve 'quality of life' and 'quality of death/dying'
        in end-of-life care by exploring achievements and challenges from a view of
        public policy. \\n\\nResearch Questions: (a) How do bioethics, human rights,
        and evidence-based medicine effect end-of-life care? (b) What are the situations
        of the quality of life and the quality of death/dying in end-of-life care?
        (c) How does the WHO's definition of 'health' fit to the changing demographics/societies?
        (d) What are the implications for improving 'quality of life' and the 'quality
        of death/dying' in end-of-life care in the aging societies? \\n\\nMethods:
        (a) Qualitative research, a powerful instrument for little studied subjects,
        will be the central analytical methodology for this proposed research. For
        data collection, analysis, and developing a theory, I will employ grounded
        theory, established by scholars who studied processes and situations of death/dying,
        which is used in health care fields. I will target interviews with one hundred
        end-of-life experts in the primary countries (Japan and the US) and other
        related countries (the UK and South Korea). I will perform open coding, axial
        coding, and theoretical coding. Theoretical sampling will be performed to
        judge a theoretical saturation (where no more new codes are being formed).
        NVivo will be used as a supporting instrument. (b) Quantitative research (typology
        and taxonomy methods) on quantifiable data will be used to fortify the analysis
        and interpretation of the qualitative research. (c) Content analysis will
        also be performed by qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies by contrasting
        my research contents.\\n\\nThe Value of the Research: A part of the proposed
        project will be conducted while serving as a coauthor of the Lancet Commission
        (2018-2019 scheduled). A synthesis of my analysis on end-of-life care, focusing
        on better life and a better death (with the Abe Fellowship Program and with
        the Lancet international project) will address the global threats of social
        and fiscal sustainability in aging societies. It will also showcase the important
        elements of interdisciplinary team-approaches, community/regional collaborations,
        and multi-sector partnerships.\",\"award_title\":\"Visiting Researcher\",\"award_institution\":\"Georgetown
