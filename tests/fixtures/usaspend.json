THE GENERAL GOALS OF UNDERSTANDING HELIOSPHERIC PHYSICS AND THE SPECIFIC GOALS OF SPACE WEATHER STUDIES  MUST DEAL AT SOME LEVEL WITH ALL OF THESE MULTI-SCALE  MULTI-REGIONAL AND MULTI-PHYSICS CHALLENGES. A GRAND CHALLENGE OBJECTIVE OF THE LIVING WITH A STAR (LWS) AND SPACE WEATHER IS TO ATTAIN  SUN-TO-MUD  DYNAMICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF STEADY AND TRANSIENT CONDITIONS. EXISTING EFFORTS HAVE GENERALLY SIMPLIFIED THE MULTI-SCALE AND MULTIPHYSICS ASPECTS IN ORDER TO ATTAIN MULTI-REGIONAL RESULTS.THE PREMISE OF THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IS THAT TO MOVE FORWARD  SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED IN THE MULTISCALE AREA WHERE MODELS NEED TO DEAL WITH THE SCALE SEPARATION PROBLEM INHERENT IN NONSTEADY NONLINEAR FLOWS  WHILE ALSO TAKING IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDSMORE REALISTIC PHYSICS BY DEVELOPING MULTIFLUID DESCRIPTIONS.THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO IMPROVE MODELING OF THE SOLAR WIND  CORONA AND ENERGETIC PARTICLES IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE  AND TO DEVELOP THREE DELIVERABLES WITHIN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD: (1) THE CENTER PIECE OF THE PROJECT IS A MULTIFLUID SOLAR WIND CODE THAT WILL INCLUDE TURBULENCE MODELING. THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL (3D) SOLAR WIND CODE WILL BE BASED ON THE CURRENT USMANOV ET AL. CODE  BUT OPERATING BETWEEN 0.1 AU AND 1 AU  THAT IS OUTSIDE THE ALFV EN CRITICAL POINT TO THE EARTH. THE TURBULENCE MODEL  CURRENTLY OF THE REYNOLDS AVERAGED NAVIER-STOKES (RANS) TYPE  WILL BE EXPANDED AND IMPROVED TO INCLUDE A LARGE EDDY SIMULATION (LES) APPROACH AND SUBGRID-SCALE MODELING. THE MODEL WILL INCLUDE PROTON  ELECTRON AND HELIUM FLUIDS; 2) AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT BOTH FOR COMPLETENESS OF SPACE WEATHER MODELING  AND TO PROVIDE BOUNDARY DATA FOR THE SOLAR WIND CODE  IS A NEW 3D CORONAL CODE IN THE SUB-ALFV ENIC REGION  ALSO INCLUDING MULTIFLUIDS AND A TURBULENCE MODEL SPECIALIZED FOR CORONAL PLASMA CONDITIONS. THIS MODEL IS MORE EXPERIMENTAL IN NATURE AND WILL REQUIRE DEVELOPMENT IN STAGES; 3) THE FINAL COMPONENT  A TRANSPORT CODE FOR ENERGETIC PARTICLES  NOTABLY SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES  WILL INCLUDE A FOCUSED TRANSPORT MODEL ADAPTED TO THE DYNAMIC SIMULATION DATA FROM MODELS (1) AND (2). THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THESE MODELS WILL BE DESIGNED FOR INTEROPERABILITY INCLUDING INTERFACING WITH MODELS DEVELOPED ELSEWHERE. WE WILL ALSO WORK TOWARD INTEGRATION OF THE TRANSPORT CODE AND INTERPLANETARY CODES WITH GLOBAL MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC (MHD) MODELS OF THE MAGNETOSPHERE TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF SPACE WEATHER EVENTS ON MAGNETOSPHERIC DYNAMICS.BY BRINGING TOGETHER AN EXPERIENCED TEAM WITH EXPERTISE IN SOLAR WIND  CORONAL  AND MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS  HYDRODYNAMIC AND MHD TURBULENCE MODELING  AND LARGE SCALE TURBULENCE  CORONAL AND SOLAR WIND SIMULATIONS  IN COMBINATION WITH EXPERIENCE IN ANALYSIS OF SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS FOR VERIFICATION AND TESTING  WE EXPECT TO MAKE STEADY AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THIS CHALLENGING AREA  LEADING TO USEFUL DELIVERABLES WITHIN BOTH THREE AND FIVE YEAR PERIODS.

NASA'S CYCLONE GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM (CYGNSS) MISSION WILL PROVIDE A VITAL PIECE OF INFORMATION IN MJO DYNAMICS: NEAR SURFACE WINDS UNDER ALL WEATHER CONDITIONS  WITH A HIGH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION. THE WORK PROPOSED HEREIN WILL INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CYGNSS DATA ON SIMULATING THE STRUCTURE AND PROPAGATION OF MJO  USING BOTH A REGIONAL MODEL AND A CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL. SINCE CYGNSS WILL NOT BE LAUNCHED UNTIL 2016  WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH-QUALITY DATASET FROM THE RECENTLY FINISHED DYNAMICS OF THE MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION (DYNAMO  OCTOBER 1  2011 ~ FEBRUARY 8  2012) FIELD CAMPAIGN.THE PROPOSED REGIONAL MODEL FOR THIS STUDY IS THE COUPLED-OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE-WAVE-SEDIMENT TRANSPORT (COAWST) MODELING SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM COUPLES THE WEATHER RESEARCH AND FORECASTING (WRF; ATMOSPHERE) MODEL  THE SIMULATING WAVES NEARSHORE (SWAN; WAVE) MODEL AND THE REGIONAL OCEAN MODELING SYSTEM (ROMS; OCEAN) VIA THE MODEL COUPLING TOOLKIT (MCT). THE CLOUD RESOLVING MODEL IS THE GODDARD CUMULUS ENSEMBLE (GCE) MODEL. WE PLAN TO FOCUS ON THE TWO WELL-OBSERVED MJO EVENTS DURING DYNAMO CAMPAIGN PERIOD IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER  2011. THE FULLY COUPLED COAWST MODEL WILL BE USED TO SIMULATE THESE EVENTS AND THE SIMULATED STORM STRUCTURE  SURFACE FLUXES  SURFACE WIND AND WAVE HEIGHTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS DURING THE DYNAMO CAMPAIGN. THE FORWARD MODEL DEVELOPED BY CYGNSS TEAM WILL BE APPLIED TO THE SWAN WAVE MODEL OUTPUT IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SYNTHETIC CYGNSS DATA FOR GENERAL PRE-LAUNCH STUDIES. IN THIS PROPOSED STUDY  THIS DATASET WILL BE USED TO NUDGE THE NEAR SURFACE WINDS IN THE CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL IN ORDER TO STUDY IMPACT OF CYGNSS DATA ON MODEL RESULTS. THE SURFACE WIND AND AIR-SEA INTERACTIONS PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN MJO DEVELOPMENT AND PROPAGATION. THE COAWST MODELING SYSTEM AND THE GCE CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL EACH HAS ITS UNIQUE ABILITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THESE TOPICS.

THE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON DYNAMICS OF CONVECTION AND ITS ASSOCIATED DOWNDRAFT  SURFACE OUTFLOW AND COLD POOL  AS WELL AS THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE OCEAN SURFACE EVAPORATION AND WAVE DRAG. THE DYNAMO DATA WILL PROVIDE GOOD CONSTRAINTS ON THESE MODEL SENSITIVITY STUDIES. FURTHERMORE  COAWST MODEL AND THE GCE MODEL SHARE THE SAME OCEAN SURFACE FLUX SCHEME. THIS SCHEME WILL BE IMPROVED USING DYNAMO CASES AND DATA. THE IMPROVED SURFACE FLUX SCHEME WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NASA UNIFIED WRF AND SENSITIVITY TESTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT.

ONE OF THE END PRODUCTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE A SET OF ESM-COMPATIBLE  PFT-SPECIFIC ALGORITHMS DESCRIBING THE TEMPERATURE RESPONSE OF THESE TWO PROCESSES TO BOTH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE.THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPORT A SERIES OF GROWTH CHAMBER- AND COMMON GARDEN-BASED MEASUREMENTS ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO TEMPERATURE OF A VARIETY OF SPECIES WITHIN ALL OF THE PFTS COMMONLY USED IN ESMS. GROWTH CHAMBER MEASUREMENTS WILL BE USED TO QUANTIFY LONG-TERM TEMPERATURE RESPONSES OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RESPIRATION IN A MANNER USEFUL FOR ESMS. COMMON GARDEN MEASUREMENTS WILL BE USED TO VALIDATE THE GROWTH CHAMBER MEASUREMENTS IN SPECIES GROWN OUTDOORS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF CLIMATE ZONES AND TEST FOR DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES AGE ON ACCLIMATORY ABILITY. THESE DATA WILL BE USED TO PARAMETERIZE THE FIRST-EVER  PFT-SPECIFIC CARBON EXCHANGE ALGORITHMS THAT INCLUDE TEMPERATURE ACCLIMATION. THESE ALGORITHMS WILL BE SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATED USING THE LAND MODEL COMPONENT OF MULTIPLE ESMS (CESM AND NOAA/GFDL ESM) IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO REPRODUCE PAST DATA COMPARED TO COMMONLY USED  NON ACCLIMATION  ALGORITHMS AT THE GLOBAL  REGIONAL  AND SITE LEVEL. GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SIMULATIONS WILL BE DRIVEN USING NASA PRODUCTS VIA THE NASA LIS AND COMPARED TO NASA MODIS PRODUCTS INCLUDING MOD16 (EVAPOTRANSPIRATION) AND MOD17 (NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION). SITE-LEVEL SIMULATIONS WILL BE DRIVEN BY HIGH-RESOLUTION REANALYSIS DATA AND COMPARED TO FLUX TOWER OBSERVATIONS. SIMULATIONS WILL ALSO BE PERFORMED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF INCLUDING TEMPERATURE ACCLIMATION ON FUTURE PROJECTIONS USING CMIP5 RCP SCENARIOS.PRELIMINARY WORK HAS SHOWN THAT TEMPERATURE ACCLIMATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND AUTOTROPHIC RESPIRATION CAN HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON FUTURE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS. IN COLLABORATION WITH LEADING RESEARCHERS IN THE ECOLOGICAL AND MODELING FIELDS  THIS PROJECT WILL NOT ONLY RESULT IN A THOROUGH  GLOBAL EVALUATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND AUTOTROPHIC RESPIRATION TEMPERATURE ACCLIMATION  BUT WILL ALSO PRODUCE THE FIRST-EVER  PFT-SPECIFIC ALGORITHMS FOR TEMPERATURE ACCLIMATION. THESE ALGORITHMS WILL BE TESTED AND THOROUGHLY EVALUATED INMULTIPLE MODELS AND WILL BE DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY CAN BE EASILY INCORPORATED INTO OTHER ESMS  INCLUDING NASA'S GISS MODELE.

THERE IS A DIRECT NEED FOR A SINGLE  AUTOMATED DESIGN AND FABRICATION PROCESS.

EMPIRICAL DESIGN WILL NOT TRANSFER TO THE PROJECTS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF BEING PRODUCED WITH THESE TECHNIQUES (OR EXAMPLE  MOBILE SOFT ROBOTS)  BECAUSE HUMAN INTUITION WILL FAIL WHEN TRYING TO PREDICT THE PERFORMANCE OF NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NOVEL MATERIALS AND FORMS AT MULTIPLE SCALES. I PROPOSE THAT EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS(EAS) ARE USED TO ITERATIVELY AND INTERACTIVELY PRODUCE DESIGNS. EAS MIMIC THE TRAITS OF BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION AND APPLY THEM TO ARTIFICIAL DESIGN OF NOVEL AND UNINTUITIVE SOLUTIONS. THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CREATE COMPLEX AND INTERESTING FORMS WITH INTERACTIVE FEEDBACK FROM A HUMAN USER  AND ALSO HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CREATE HIGH PERFORMING SOLUTIONS WHEN LEFT TO OPTIMIZE PRODUCT DESIGN TOWARDS ONE OR MORE OBJECTIVE FEATURE. EXAMPLES OF EA PERFORMANCE INCLUDE A PART DEPLOYED ON THE NASA ST5 SPACECRAFT WHICH OUTPERFORMED ALL OF THE ALTERNATIVE HUMAN DESIGNED SOLUTIONS OR SPECIALIZED CRUMPLE ZONES IN INDUSTRY LEADING AUTOMOBILES.

DESIGNS THAT ARE NOVEL  INTERESTING  ATTRACTIVE  OR PROMISING). THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT PRESSURES ARE SHAPING THE DESIGN FROM DIFFERENT SYSTEMS (THE USER'S PREFERENCES AND THE COMPUTER'S PERFORMANCE METRIC) WILL OVERCOME MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WITH LOCAL OPTIMA AND LACK OF DIVERSITY THAT EAS HAVE FACED IN THE PAST. ADDITIONALLY  RECENT WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THE USE OF DRIVERS SUCH AS INTERESTINGNESS OR NOVELTY CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE DRIVERS OF EAS THAN A DIRECT PERFORMANCE METRIC. THE ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS OF AN EA MEANS THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A FUNCTIONALLY VIABLE  FULLY DESCRIBED  DESIGN THAT IS BEING OPTIMIZED. THUS AT ANY POINT IN TIME  THE BEST CURRENT DESIGN CAN BE SENT TO A 3D PRINTER FOR IMMEDIATE FABRICATION. THIS DESIGN TOOL WOULD CONTAIN PROPERTIES SUCH AS: IMMEDIATE AND INDIVIDUALIZED FABRICATION POTENTIAL OF CURRENT DESIGNS; LACK OF NEED FOR DOMAIN SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OR FOR FULL INTUITION OF THE (USUALLY NON-LINEAR) CONSTRAINTS AND PROCESSES OCCURRING (AND BEING OPTIMIZED) AT MULTIPLE SCALES; AND THE SOLE REQUIREMENTS OF A HIGH LEVEL PERFORMANCE METRIC AND GENERAL HUMAN INTUITION.

RECENT OBSERVATIONS IN EXTREME ULTRA-VIOLET WAVELENGTHS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE CORONA OSCILLATES AT MANY DIFFERENT SPATIAL SIZES AND TEMPORAL FREQUENCIES. HOWEVER  MUCH REMAINS UNKNOWN ABOUT MANY OF THESE OSCILLATIONS; THEY ARE INTERMITTENT FOR UNKNOWN REASONS  APPEAR ON SOME CORONAL FEATURES AND NOT ON OTHER  SIMILAR  NEIGHBORING FEATURES  AND MAY (OR MAY NOT) BE MAGNETOHYRODYNAMIC WAVE MODES. DEFINITIVE CAUSES OF THE STRUCTURE AND ORIGINS OF THESE OSCILLATIONS IS STILL LARGELY LACKING. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY HOW AND WHY FEATURESIN THE CORONA OSCILLATE  AND IF THEY OSCILLATE AS IDENTIFIABLE WAVE MODES. WE WILL MAKE USE OF AUTOMATED DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF SDO-AIA DATA AVAILABLE. FIRST  WE WILL MEASURE THE OSCILLATION CONTENT OFDIFFERENT PHYSICAL REGIONS ON THE SUN IN SDO AIA DATA. WE WILL DO THIS USING THREE DIFFERENT AUTOMATED OSCILLATION DETECTION ALGORITHMS (DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY) TO VALIDATE THE RESULTS. THE MEASURED OSCILLATION CONTENT WILL BE CORRELATED WITH OTHER MEASURES OF THOSE REGIONS SUCH AS AREA  TOTAL UNSIGNED MAGNETIC FLUX  AND AGE TO OBTAIN BASIC INFORMATION ON THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR AN OSCILLATION TO OCCUR  BASIC INFORMATION THAT HAS  AS YET  NOT BEEN OBTAINED. WE WILL EXTRACT ALL THIS CONTENT IN EACH AIA PASSBAND. FURTHER  WEWILL ROUTINELY MEASURE THE CORONAL OSCILLATION CONTENT OF THE SUN IN THE CURRENT SOLAR CYCLE  AND PROVIDE THOSE MEASUREMENTS ONLINE. SECOND  WE NEED TO KNOW THE PHYSICAL SIZE OF THE COHERENT OSCILLATING STRUCTURE AND WHAT KIND OF STRUCTURE THE OSCILLATIONS OCCUR ON. WE WILL DO THIS BY IMPLEMENTING PIXEL GROUPING AND OSCILLATORY SIGNAL COHERENCE ALGORITHMS TO DETECT COHERENTLY OSCILLATING STRUCTURES. FURTHER  WE WILL DEVELOP A 3D WAVELET ALGORITHM AND A CURVELET-BASED TEXTURE ANALYSIS THAT CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NARROW AND EXTENDED CURVILINEAR FEATURES  SUCH AS CORONAL LOOPS  AND NON-LOOP EMISSION ON THE SUN. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY LOOP-LIKE FEATURES AT MULTIPLE LENGTH-SCALES (LARGE LOOPS IN ACTIVE REGIONS  SMALL LOOPS IN CORONAL HOLES AND QUIET SUN)  AND OTHER TYPES OF EMISSION  SUCH AS PLAGE OR MOSS IN EACH AIA PASSBAND. THIRD  WE WILL STUDY OF ORIGINS OF LONGITUDINAL OSCILLATIONS AND FLARE-INDUCED KINK WAVES. THE COMBINATION OF AUTOMATED DETECTION OF THE OSCILLATIONS  AND THE STRUCTURE SUPPORTING THESE OSCILLATIONS  AS MEASURED IN EACH OF THE SDO PASSBANDS  WILL ALLOW US TO TEST THEORIES OF OSCILLATION PROPAGATION  CORONAL HEATING  AND ENERGY DECAY MECHANISMS IN THE SOLARATMOSPHERE.

IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH CELL OUTPUT  THECONCENTRATION OF THE DIFFERENT BLOOD CELL LINEAGES PRODUCED ARE PRECISELY CONTROLLED TO ALLOW NOT ONLY PRESERVATION OF NORMALHOMEOSTASIS  BUT ALSO THE PROMPT RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC STIMULI AND DEMANDS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT EXPOSURE TO GALACTICCOSMIC RAY (GCR) AND SOLAR PARTICLE EVENT (SPE) RADIATION THAT OCCURS DURING SPACE FLIGHT MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OFCARCINOGENESIS  WITH LEUKEMIAS BEING ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT RADIOGENIC CANCERS  AND THE ONES WITH THE SMALLEST LATENCY PERIOD. WEHYPOTHESIZE THAT GCR AND SPE RADIATION CAN HAVE A DELETERIOUS IMPACT NOT ONLY AT THE LEVEL OF THE MATURE IMMUNE CELLS AND THEIRCOMMITTED PROGENITORS  AS IS CURRENTLY THOUGHT  BUT AT THE EARLIER DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE OF THE HSC. GENETIC LESIONS INDUCED BY THISEXPOSURE CAN LEAD DIRECTLY TO LEUKEMIC TRANSFORMATION  AND MAY ALSO CAUSE THESE CELLS TO GENERATE A FUNCTIONALLY COMPROMISED IMMUNESYSTEM LACKING THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY FIGHT CHALLENGES SUCH AS PRE-LEUKEMIC TRANSFORMATIONS. AS SUCH  ASTRONAUTS WOULD BE DOUBLY ATRISK  DUE TO BOTH THE POTENTIAL FOR INDUCTION OF LEUKEMIA BY GCR/SPE RADIATION  AND THE REDUCED ABILITY OF THE ASTRONAUTS  IMMUNESYSTEMS TO IDENTIFY AND ELIMINATE MALIGNANT CELLS IN THE BODY. SINCE IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT BOTH GENDER AND GENETIC FACTORS LIKELYIMPACT UPON SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LEUKEMOGENESIS  IT IS ESSENTIAL TO PRECISELY DEFINE THESE RISKS TO THE HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC SYSTEM AS A RESULTOF EXPOSURE TO GCR/SPE AND TO ACCURATELY MODEL THE IMPACT OF GENDER AND GENETIC/EPIGENETIC BACKGROUND. UNFORTUNATELY  EXISTINGANIMAL MODEL SYSTEMS HAVE NOT ALLOWED THE PRECISE ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE OR CHRONIC EXPOSURE OF HUMANHEMATOPOIETIC CELLS TO GCR OR SPE  NOR THE ELUCIDATION OF THE MECHANISM INVOLVED.IN THE PRESENT PROPOSAL  WE HAVE FORMED A HIGHLY SYNERGISTIC TEAM TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THIS TEAM COMBINES THECOMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE OF 6 DIFFERENT LABORATORIES: HUMAN HSC AND CELLS OF THE SUPPORTING BM MICROENVIRONMENT (PORADA ANDALMEIDA-PORADA GROUPS)  TISSUE ENGINEERING/SCAFFOLDS (SOKER GROUP)  BIOINFORMATICS/GENOMICS (WALKER GROUP)  AND RADIATION BIOLOGY(WILSON AND ANDERSON GROUPS).

AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF MATERIAL DESIGN ARE COMPLEX MATERIALS: HYBRIDS  COMPOSITES  AND ALLOYS WHOSE CONSTITUENTSAND PROCESSING DETAILS CAN LEAD TO A WIDE RANGE OF PROPERTIES. THE DESIGN OF A COMPLEX MATERIAL CAN BE FOCUSED TOWARDS SPECIFIC OR MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS  AND TAILORED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A GIVEN MISSION.HYBRID MATERIALS ARE DEFINED BY TWO DISTINCT CONSTITUENTS MIXED AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL  USUALLY AN INORGANIC PHASE INTERMIXED WITH LARGE ORGANIC MOLECULES. THE FIELD OF NANOCOMPOSITES INTERSECTS SOMEWHAT WITH THE FIELD OF HYBRID MATERIALS  THOUGH COMPOSITE MATERIALS ARE TYPICALLY DISTINGUISHED BY LARGER SPATIAL SEPARATION BETWEEN CONSTITUENTS. COMPLEX MATERIALS MAY OFFER THE PROPERTIES OFTWO DIFFERENT MATERIALS IN PARALLEL  WITH ADDITIONAL EFFECTS DUE TO CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS. FURTHERMORE  ALLOYS AND HYBRIDS CAN FORM THE CONSTITUENTS OF ADVANCED COMPOSITES. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE EXTREMELY NUMEROUS IN DESIGNING COMPLEX MATERIALS  TO THE EXTENT THATEXPERIMENTAL TRIAL AND ERROR BECOMES IMPRACTICAL AND COSTLY. WE PROPOSE THAT MATERIAL SIMULATION TECHNIQUES MAY HAVE MUCH TO OFFER IN THE DESIGN OF COMPLEX MATERIALS  FROM HIGH-THROUGHPUT MATERIAL SELECTION TO DETAILED OBSERVATION OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES IN A GIVEN ENVIRONMENT.HERE  WE FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATOMISTIC (ATOM-BY-ATOM) MODELS FOR COMPLEX MATERIALS IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. EMPIRICAL MODELS  IN WHICH ATOMS ARE ASSUMED TO EXHIBIT PARAMETERIZED INTERATOMIC POTENTIALS  OFTEN LACK THE TRANSFERABILITY NECESSARY TO EXPLORE EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE TYPICALLY FIT TO A SET OF PROPERTIES WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELIABLE OUTSIDE OF THE RANGE OF FITTING. FOR THIS REASON  IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPLOY QUANTUM MECHANICAL METHODS AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER  COMPLEX MATERIAL SYSTEMS NATURALLY REQUIRE A LARGE NUMBER OF ATOMS TO CONSTRUCT A REPRESENTATIVE UNIT  PRESENTING A PROBLEM FOR QUANTUM METHODS IN WHICH COMPUTATION TIME SCALES AT BEST QUADRATICALLY WITH SYSTEM SIZE.DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY (DFT) CALCULATIONS HAVE BECOME WIDELY UTILIZED IN MATERIAL SIMULATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR REMARKABLE ABILITY TO REPRODUCE MEASURED QUANTITIES. DFT CALCULATIONS ARE LIMITED TO A FEW HUNDRED ATOMS ON A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SYSTEM. THIS MAY BE ENOUGH TO STUDY THE GROUND STATE PROPERTIES OF COMPLEX MATERIAL SYSTEMS  BUT DFT IS KNOWN TO MISREPRESENT CERTAIN INTERACTIONS THAT ARE LIKELY RELEVANT TO THE PROBLEM OF COMPLEX MATERIALS DESIGN  SUCH AS VAN DER WAALS (VDW) BONDING. EMPIRICAL EXTENSIONS TO DFT ARE COMMONLY EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE RESOLUTION OF SUCH MISREPRESENTED EFFECTS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE EMPIRICAL CORRECTIONS TO QUANTUM MODELS AND/OR APPLICATION OF KNOWN MACROSCOPIC PROPERTIES TO SHRINK THE REPRESENTATIVE UNIT FOR ATOMISTIC CALCULATIONS. SUCH APPROXIMATIONSWILL CERTAINLY BE NECESSARY TO APPROACH THE PROBLEM OF MODELING COMPLEX MATERIALS  ESPECIALLY IN CONSIDERATION OF TIME-DEPENDENT PROCESSES IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS.WE CONSIDER ONE IMPORTANT APPLICATION IN SPACE TECHNOLOGY: DESIGN OF HYBRID MATERIALS FOR THERMALLY PROTECTIVE ABLATORS DURING ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY. ENGINEERED HYBRID MATERIALS ARE ATTRACTIVE FOR THIS APPLICATION  AS THERE WILL BE A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR A GIVEN ASCENT. MECHANICAL STABILITY AND PRECISELY TUNED ABLATION CHARACTERISTICS ARE DESIRABLE  AND THERE IS POTENTIAL TO ENGINEER ENHANCED OPTICAL PROPERTIES (AT ATOMIC AS WELL AS PHOTONIC SCALES) TO REDUCE RADIATIVE HEATING. THE ACTUAL THERMAL  MECHANICAL  AND OPTICAL DESIGN GOALS WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE ATMOSPHERE AND VEHICLE OF INTEREST. A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL COULD BE USED FIRST TO SELECTCANDIDATE MATERIALS FOR A GIVEN APPLICATION  THEN TO ISOLATE AND TUNE THE RELEVANT DEGREES OF FREEDOM FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE  AND FINALLY TO EXPAND THE SCALE TO AN ACTUAL DEVICE AND INEXPENSIVELY TEST THE DESIGN.\",\"Start Date\":\"2012-09-01\",\"End Date\":\"2017-01-12\",\"Award Amount\":162884.5,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX12AM48H_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49203539,\"Award ID\":\"NNX12AM25G\",\"Recipient Name\":\"ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI\",\"Description\":\"THIS PROJECT WILL ASSESS PERFORMANCE ON A VARIETY OF SENSORIMOTOR TASKS (THE SENSORIMOTOR TEST BATTERY) AND COMPARE THE RESULTS OF THESE TEST WITH OP\",\"Start Date\":\"2012-08-16\",\"End Date\":\"2016-11-09\",\"Award Amount\":1033879.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":null,\"Funding Sub Agency\":null,\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX12AM25G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49203534,\"Award ID\":\"NNX12AM20G\",\"Recipient Name\":\"TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE\",\"Description\":\"WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT A FIELD-VALIDATED SPATIAL-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN RIVER CHANNEL SEDIMENT COMPOSITION AND MOISTURE CONTENT TO TEST HYPOT\",\"Start Date\":\"2012-07-18\",\"End Date\":null,\"Award Amount\":686349.17,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX12AM20G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49203512,\"Award ID\":\"NNX12AL95G\",\"Recipient Name\":\"UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM\",\"Description\":\"RECENTLY A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR BETTER SIMULATION OF CLOUDS IN GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS (GCMS).

THESE GPS NETWORKS ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME. THEY ARE USED PRIMARILY FOR POSITIONING AND TO PROVIDE PRECISE ORBITS FOR MANY NASA SATELLITE AND AIRBORNE MISSIONS. IT HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED THAT DATA FROM THESE SAME SITES CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE INTEGRATED MEASUREMENTS OF WATER VAPOR AND TOTAL ELECTRON CONTENT  THUS MAKING GPS A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ATMOSPHERE. MORE RECENTLY IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THESE SAME GPS GROUND NETWORKS  IF PROPERLY SITED  PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE LAND SURFACE SURROUNDING THE GPS ANTENNA  IN THE FORM OF SOIL MOISTURE  SNOW DEPTH  AND BIOMASS PRODUCTS. THE BENEFIT OF REFLECTION DATA DERIVED FROM GPS GROUND NETWORKS FOR HYDROLOGICAL STUDIES WOULD BE THREE-FOLD. FIRST  BY USING NETWORKS THAT ALREADY EXIST AND HAVE SUPPORT FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES  NASA WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE USEFUL SCIENTIFIC DATA AT LOW COST. SECONDLY  THE FOOTPRINT OF A GROUND GPS SITE IS INTERMEDIATE TO IN SITU PROBES AND SATELLITE SENSORS. THE FORMER (10S OF CMS) FAILS TO CAPTURE THE TRUE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THE HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETER WHILE THE LATER IS OFTEN TOO LARGE (10S OF KMS). ASSIMILATION MODELS THAT INCLUDE BOTH IN SITU AND SATELLITE DATA CAN BE IMPROVED BY HAVING SUCH AN INTERMEDIATE-SCALE SENSOR. FINALLY  HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENT  AS SOIL MOISTURE DATA ARE USED IN WEATHER FORECASTS AND CLIMATE MODELS. SNOWPACK AND MELT RATE INFORMATION ARE NEEDED FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER SUPPLY AND FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEMS  PARTICULARLY IN THE MORE ARID WESTERN U.S. ESTIMATES OF BIOMASS/VEGETATION STATE ARE ALSO REQUIRED FOR ASSIMILATION MODELS AND FOR VALIDATION OF SATELLITE SURVEYS OF LAND SURFACE CONDITIONS. WHILE THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP NEW HYDROLOGICAL PRODUCTS FROM GPS REFLECTION DATA  KNOWLEDGE OF HYDROLOGICAL SIGNALS IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING POSITIONING ACCURACY OF GPS. THE LATTER IS A KEY DRIVER IN THE ACCURACY OF THE INTERNATIONAL TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME.

SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THIS CAPABILITY WILL ENABLE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF COMPLEX FLOW PHYSICS DRIVING IMPORTANT DESIGN METRICS  WHICH IN TURN WILL ENABLE MORE AGGRESSIVE DESIGNS AT LOWER RISK. NEW CONCEPTS AND CONFIGURATIONS OFTEN RELY ON DIFFERENT FLOW PHYSICS THAT PROGRAMS MUST BE ABLE TO SIMULATE WITH CONFIDENCE IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE DESIGNS AND REDUCE RISK. AT THE SAME TIME  SIMULATIONS FOR TRADITIONAL FIXED WING CONFIGURATIONS ARE SEVERELY LACKING IN CRITICAL REGIONS OF THE FLIGHT REGIME SUCH AS NEAR STALL  AT HIGH-LIFT CONDITIONS  IN DEFLECTED CONTROL SURFACE CONDITIONS AND AT THE EDGES OF THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE.

A SOLUTION APPROACH FOR THESE THREE PROBLEMS WAS RECENTLY SUGGESTED BY THE PI.

THESE NEW UNIFIED AND DYNAMIC LES METHODS HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES COMPARED TO EXISTING METHODS. ON THE OTHER HAND  THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THESE METHODS DO NOT REPRESENT THE FINAL ANSWER TO THE THREE LES PROBLEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE BECAUSE OF THEIR DEFICIENCIES IN ACCURATELY REPRESENTING THE SPATIOTEMPORAL STRUCTURE OF TURBULENT FLOWS.

RATIONALE: THE RUSSIAN AND CHINESE PORTIONS OF THE STUDY REGION PRESENT CONTRASTING POLITICAL SYSTEMS OPERATING ON SIMILAR LANDSCAPES OVER VERY DIFFERENT ERAS IN THEIR RECENT HISTORIES. THE ABRUPT CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIES OF RUSSIA AND CHINA OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS  AND THE REGION'S IMPORTANCE AS A LOCUS OF FOREST RESOURCES  CARBON AND BIODIVERSITY MAKE THIS AREA A PARTICULARLY CRITICAL HOT-SPOT OF CHANGE AND CONFLICTING ECONOMIC INTERESTS. LOCATED IN EARTH'S LARGEST FOREST  THE REGION IS ALSO PREDICTED TO SHOW SOME OF THE GREATEST CHANGE IN CLIMATE OVER THE NEAR FUTURE. THE CRITICAL ISSUE AND OUR DRIVING RESEARCH QUESTION FOR THIS SYNTHESIS PROJECT IS THE FOLLOWING: HOW HAVE HUMAN-DRIVEN DISTURBANCES RELATED TO USE OF FOREST RESOURCES  COMBINED WITH NATURAL OR INTERACTING DISTURBANCES (E.G. FIRES)  CREATED THE LANDSCAPES OF THE REGION OVER THE PAST 35 YEARS? HOW MIGHT THEY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE? TO ANSWER  WE MUST INTEGRATE HUMAN AND NATURAL DRIVERS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. THEREFORE THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS SYNTHESIS IS TO QUANTIFY AND ATTRIBUTE CHANGES IN LAND-USE AND LAND-COVER DUE TO CLIMATIC VARIABILITY AND DUE TO CHANGING SOCIO-ECONOMIC DRIVERS IN THIS LARGE REGION. WE WILL BUILD OUR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES AND APPROACH TO SYNTHESIZE RESEARCH PREVIOUSLY FUNDED BY NASA LCLUC AND OTHER RELATED PROGRAMS  BY (1) SYNTHESIZING LOCAL AND SMALL-REGIONAL LANDSAT-BASED CASE STUDIES PREVIOUSLY FUNDED BY NASA  (2) MAPPING CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OF THE LAND COVER AND FOREST COMPOSITION FROM THE MODIS DATA APPLYING THE PAST DISTURBANCE RECONSTRUCTION APPROACH RECENTLY DEVELOPED FOR THE REGION  (3) EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATIC CHANGE ON FOREST COMPOSITION AND CHARACTERISTICS USING THE INDIVIDUAL-BASED FOREST GAP MODEL (IBM) FAREAST TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL VEGETATION COMPOSITION UNDER DIFFERENT CLIMATE SCENARIOS IN COMBINATION WITH OBSERVED RATES OF NATURAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DISTURBANCES  AND (4) ATTRIBUTING FOREST CHARACTERISTICS TO CHANGING FOREST POLICIES AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN RUSSIA AND CHINA OVER THE PAST 35 YEARS  USING A SYSTEMS DYNAMICS MODEL TO INTEGRATE AND ILLUSTRATE THE IMPACT OF THESE DRIVERS. THE RESULTS OF THESE FOUR OBJECTIVES ARE THREE INTERMEDIATE YET STAND-ALONE SYNTHESIS OUTPUTS (LANDSAT CASE STUDY SITES AND LCLUC RECORDS  REGION-WIDE MODIS-DERIVED DISTURBANCE RECORD  AND MULTIPLE REGION-WIDE IBM-DERIVED SCENARIOS) AND ANALYSES DERIVED FROM THEM; AND ONE CAPSTONE MODELING INTEGRATION (SYSTEMS DYNAMIC MODEL  SCENARIOS AND ANALYSES).

FOR SEVERAL WET AND DRY YEARS  WE WILL ASSEMBLE A SET OF PRODUCTS AND THEIR VALIDATION DATASETS. THE VALIDATION DATA WILL INCLUDE A COMPREHENSIVE (~1000) SET OF LANDSAT SCENES  AUGMENTED AT SOME LOCATIONS AND TIMES BY HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA (DIGITIZED AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS  QUICKBIRD IMAGER  AND DECLASSIFIED IMAGES FROM NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE SATELLITES) FROM WHICH ACCURATE BINARY MAPS OF SNOW COVER CAN BE CREATED. WE WILL VALIDATE SNOW IN THE FORESTS WITH EXISTING LIDAR SNOW SURVEY DATA  TO CHARACTERIZE SNOW DEPTH VARIABILITY AT SUB-METER SCALES  INCLUDING SUB-CANOPY AREAS. WE WILL USE ALSO USE EXISTING ULTRASONIC SNOW DEPTH SENSORS TO CHARACTERIZE SNOW ACCUMULATION  MELT  AND DURATION IN OPEN  CANOPY-EDGE  AND SUB-CANOPY CONDITIONS.

DURING PERSISTENT CLOUD COVER  THE ONLY VIEW OF THE GROUND FOR A WEEK OR TWO MIGHT WELL BE AT SUCH A HIGHLY OBLIQUE ANGLE. TO EVALUATE FRACTIONAL SNOW COVER IN THOSE SITUATIONS  WE WILL USE LANDSAT TM OR ETM+ SCENES THAT COINCIDE WITH THE EDGES OF SNOW-COVERED MODIS IMAGES. WE WILL COMPARE TIME-SPACE SMOOTHING AND INTERPOLATION TO A SEQUENCE OF LANDSAT TM OR ETM+ SCENES OVER THE SIERRA NEVADA FROM 2000 TO PRESENT  FOCUSING ESPECIALLY ON LOCATIONS AND TIMES WHEN THE SMOOTHED AND INTERPOLATED PRODUCT DIFFERS FROM THE RAW MODIS FRACTIONAL SNOW COVER.

WE HAVE ACCESS TO SNOW ALBEDO DATA AND COINCIDENT AVIRIS IMAGERY FROM FIELD SITES AT THE SENATOR BECK BASIN IN THE SAN JUAN MOUNTAINS  COLORADO AND AT MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN IN THE SIERRA NEVADA  CALIFORNIA. WE WILL USE THESE DATA TO VALIDATE AVIRIS-DERIVED SNOW ALBEDO  AND THEN COINCIDENT AVIRIS/MODIS DATA TO VALIDATE MODIS-DERIVED ALBEDO. THE MODIS CLOUD PRODUCT CONTAINS ERRORS OF BOTH OMISSION AND COMMISSION  AND ALL MODIS SNOW PRODUCTS SOMETIMES CONFUSE CLOUDS AND SNOW. THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUITY PRODUCT ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT THIS BY FORCING SNOW THAT IS TOO FINE-GRAINED AND COVERS THE WHOLE PIXEL TO BE CLASSIFIED AS CLOUD  WHILE CLOUDS THAT ARE TOO COARSE-GRAINED ARE CLASSIFIED AS SNOW. WE WILL VALIDATE THIS APPROACH USING LANDSAT TM AND ETM+  WHICH CAN IDENTIFY CLOUDS BOTH BY TEXTURE AND BY SNOW/CLOUD CONTRAST IN BAND 5. SNOWMELT RUNOFF FORECASTING IN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS HAS HISTORICALLY USED EMPIRICAL MODELS FORCED BY SPARSE  IN SITU MEASUREMENTS.

WE PROPOSE TO ANALYZE THE CHLORINE ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF A DIVERSE SUITE OF CARBONACEOUS  ORDINARY AND ENSTATITE CHONDRITES IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE DEGREE OF CL ISOTOPE HETEROGENEITY OF THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA. CHLORINE IS AN UNUSUAL ELEMENT IN THAT EQUILIBRIUM ISOTOPE FRACTIONATIONS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL AND THE NUMBER OF NEBULAR PHASES THAT CONTAIN CHLORINE IS VERY LIMITED. THEREFORE FRACTIONATION (OR A LACK THEREOF) OF CL ISOTOPES BETWEEN METEORITE TYPES AND/OR INDIVIDUAL PHASES CAN PLACE PROFOUND CONSTRAINTS ON EARLY NEBULAR CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE  HCL AND NACL ARE CONSIDERED AS MAJOR CL-BEARING HIGH-T PHASES IN THE EARLY NEBULA. THE CL ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION BETWEEN THEM IS LARGE ENOUGH SO THAT RAYLEIGH FRACTIONATION PROCESSES COULD CONTRIBUTE TO LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE CL ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF DIFFERENT PHASES. IF  HOWEVER  ONLY ONE OF THESE TWO GASES WAS PREVALENT  THEN NO ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION COULD HAVE OCCURRED. WE WILL ANALYZE WATER-SOLUBLE CL AND INSOLUBLE RESIDUE FROM BULK CHONDRITE SAMPLES USING A HIGH-SENSITIVITY MICRO-ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE DEVELOPED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO. ONLY 20 MICROGRAMS OF CL ARE NEEDED FOR AN ANALYSIS  MAKING ANALYSES OF RARE METEORITES FEASIBLE. WE WILL ALSO MAKE IN SITU ANALYSES OF WELL CHARACTERIZED CL-BEARING PHASES  SODALITE  APATITE  AND GLASS USING THE UCLA CAMECA IONPROBE. WE WILL USE SODALITE  APATITE AND SYNTHETIC GLASS STANDARDS  DEVELOPED IN OUR FACILITY  TO AVOID INSTRUMENT FRACTIONATIONS. IN OUR ORIGINAL WORK (NATURE 446  1062-1065)  WE FOUND THAT THE SODALITE IN ALLENDE CHONDRITE WAS OVER 1 PER MIL LIGHTER THAN THE BULK SAMPLE. IF  UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION  THESE DATA ARE CONFIRMED  IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE WAS AN EARLY  HIGH TEMPERATURE FRACTIONATION BETWEEN NACL (GAS) AND HCL (GAS)  PRESENT IN SUB-EQUAL AMOUNTS THAT RESULTED IN TWO DISTINCT CL RESERVOIRS. BY ANALYZING A DIVERSE SUITE OF METEORITES  WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN CL ISOTOPE VALUES AND OTHER GEOCHEMICAL INDICATORS  SUCH AS 17-O ANOMALIES. THREE YEARS OF FUNDING ARE REQUESTED  FORMING THE MAJOR PART OF A GRADUATE STUDENT'S THESIS. AFTER HAVING SPENT SEVERAL YEARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING  WE HAVE ARRIVED AT A POINT WHERE CL ISOTOPE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE RAPIDLY  ON SMALL AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL  AND WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY. BY STUDYING A LARGE NUMBER OF PRIMITIVE CHONDRITIC METEORITES  WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE THE FULL RANGE OF CL ISOTOPE VARIATION IN THIS GROUP  AND TO EVALUATE THE DATA IN TERMS OF PETROLOGIC TYPE  WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING CL-BEARING PHASE RELATIONS IN THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA.\",\"Start Date\":\"2008-05-01\",\"End Date\":null,\"Award Amount\":221998.07,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX08AI45G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49193805,\"Award ID\":\"NNX07AH53G\",\"Recipient Name\":\"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, THE\",\"Description\":\"BEYOND THE COOL CORES IN GALAXY CLUSTERS: TESTING A HIERARCHICAL MODEL WITH X-RAY OBSERVATIONS AND A\",\"Start Date\":\"2007-04-05\",\"End Date\":\"2012-05-29\",\"Award Amount\":332700.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":null,\"Funding Sub Agency\":null,\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX07AH53G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49191818,\"Award ID\":\"NNA09DA76A\",\"Recipient Name\":\"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE\",\"Description\":\"TITLE: SIGNATURES OF LIFE FROM EARTH AND BEYOND IS IN RESPONSE TO CAN #NNH08ZDA002C  NASA ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE  -  CYCLE 5  BASIC AWARD FOR CYCLE FIVE OF NAI TO PENN STATE.1260.51 COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT SPECIAL CONDITION.

TOGETHER WITH NEW CO-INVESTIGATORS FROM UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA  LOS ANGELES AND CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY  WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP NOVEL APPROACHES TO DETECTING AND CHARACTERIZING LIFE  INVESTIGATE BIOSIGNATURES IN MISSION-RELEVANT ECOSYSTEMS AND ANCIENT ROCKS  AND EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL FOR BIOSIGNATURES IN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SETTINGS.(1) DEVELOPING NEW BIOSIGNATURES   THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF POTENTIAL INDICATORS OF LIFE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROVIDING A CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR EXPLORATION OF LIFE IN THE COSMOS.  OUR EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON CREATING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR THE ANALYSES OF CELLS AND OTHER ORGANIC MATERIAL  FINDING WAYS IN WHICH METAL ABUNDANCES AND ISOTOPE SYSTEMS REFLECT LIFE  AND DEVELOPING CREATIVE APPROACHES FOR USING ENVIRONMENTAL DNA TO STUDY PRESENT AND PAST LIFE.(2) BIOSIGNATURES IN RELEVANT MICROBIAL ECOSYSTEMS   PSARC WILL INVESTIGATE MICROBIAL LIFE IN SOME OF EARTH S MOST MISSION-RELEVANT ECOSYSTEMS  THE DEAD SEA  THE CHESAPEAKE IMPACT STRUCTURE  THE METHANE SEEPS OF THE EEL RIVER BASIN  AND THE GREENLAND GLACIER ICE.(3) BIOSIGNATURES IN ANCIENT ROCKS   THE EARTH S ARCHEAN AND PROTEROZOICEONS OFFER THE BEST OPPORTUNITY OF INVESTIGATING A MICROBIAL WORLD  SUCH AS MIGHT BE FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THE COSMOS.  THE ANCIENT RECORD ON EARTH PROVIDES ON OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT GEOCHEMICAL SIGNATURES ARE PRODUCED BY MICROBIAL LIFE AND HOW THESE SIGNATURES ARE PRESERVED OVER GEOLOGIC TIME.(4) BIOSIGNATURES IN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SETTING.  PSARC WILL INVESTIGATE THE ABUNDANCE OF SULFUR GASES AND ELUCIDATE HOW THESE GASES CAN BE EXPECTED TO EVOLVE WITH TIME ON YOUNG TERRESTRIAL PLANETS.  WE WILL CONTINUE STUDIES OF PLANET FORMATION IN THE PRESENCE OF MIGRATION AND MODEL RADIAL TRANSPORT OF VOLATILES IN YOUNG PLANETARY SYSTEMS.  FINAL PSARC WILL BE INVOLVED WITH SEARCHES FOR M STAR PLANETARY COMPANIONS AND PLANETS AROUND K-GIANT STARS.(B) THE TERMS ....(C) NASA S ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE ....\",\"Start Date\":\"2009-02-01\",\"End Date\":null,\"Award Amount\":8489419.43,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNA09DA76A_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49117391,\"Award ID\":\"NA12OAR4310058\",\"Recipient Name\":\"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, THE\",\"Description\":\"DRAKE PASSAGE AS A TEST BED FOR LARGE-SCALE CHANGES IN SOUTHERN OCEAN BIOGEOCHEMISTRY\",\"Start Date\":\"2012-06-01\",\"End Date\":\"2017-05-31\",\"Award Amount\":474479.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"Department of Commerce\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":\"Department of Commerce\",\"Funding Sub Agency\":\"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\",\"awarding_agency_id\":183,\"agency_slug\":\"department-of-commerce\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NA12OAR4310058_1330\"},{\"internal_id\":49117102,\"Award ID\":\"NA12NMF4720252\",\"Recipient Name\":\"UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH\",\"Description\":\"TESTING OF A MODIFIED GROUNDGEAR TO REDUCE YELLOWTAIL FLOUNDER AND JUVENILE COD IN THE LARGE MESH GROUNDFISH FISHERY ON GEORGES BANK\",\"Start Date\":\"2012-10-01\",\"End Date\":\"2014-09-30\",\"Award Amount\":184674.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"Department of Commerce\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":null,\"Funding Sub Agency\":null,\"awarding_agency_id\":183,\"agency_slug\":\"department-of-commerce\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NA12NMF4720252_1330\"},{\"internal_id\":49116941,\"Award ID\":\"NA12NMF4390130\",\"Recipient Name\":\"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS\",\"Description\":\"DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SUPPORT FOR THE MARINE MAMMAL HEALTH AND STRANDING NETWORK\",\"Start Date\":\"2012-08-01\",\"End Date\":\"2014-07-30\",\"Award Amount\":95614.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"Department of Commerce\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":null,\"Funding Sub Agency\":null,\"awarding_agency_id\":183,\"agency_slug\":\"department-of-commerce\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NA12NMF4390130_1330\"},{\"internal_id\":49115504,\"Award ID\":\"NA10NMF4540111\",\"Recipient Name\":\"TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY-CORPUS CHRISTI\",\"Description\":\"ISNAPPER: DESIGN  TESTING  AND ANALYSIS OF AN IPHONE-BASED APPLICATION AS AN ELECTRONIC LOGBOOK IN THE FOR-HIRE FISHERIES.\",\"Start Date\":\"2010-08-01\",\"End Date\":\"2013-07-31\",\"Award Amount\":178886.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"Department of Commerce\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":null,\"Funding Sub Agency\":null,\"awarding_agency_id\":183,\"agency_slug\":\"department-of-commerce\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NA10NMF4540111_1330\"}],\"page_metadata\":{\"page\":4,\"hasNext\":true,\"last_record_unique_id\":49115504,\"last_record_sort_value\":\"NA10NMF4540111\"},\"messages\":[\"For searches, time period start and end dates are currently limited to an earliest date of 2007-10-01.

THE GENERAL GOALS OF UNDERSTANDING HELIOSPHERIC PHYSICS AND THE SPECIFIC GOALS OF SPACE WEATHER STUDIES  MUST DEAL AT SOME LEVEL WITH ALL OF THESE MULTI-SCALE  MULTI-REGIONAL AND MULTI-PHYSICS CHALLENGES. A GRAND CHALLENGE OBJECTIVE OF THE LIVING WITH A STAR (LWS) AND SPACE WEATHER IS TO ATTAIN  SUN-TO-MUD  DYNAMICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF STEADY AND TRANSIENT CONDITIONS. EXISTING EFFORTS HAVE GENERALLY SIMPLIFIED THE MULTI-SCALE AND MULTIPHYSICS ASPECTS IN ORDER TO ATTAIN MULTI-REGIONAL RESULTS.THE PREMISE OF THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IS THAT TO MOVE FORWARD  SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED IN THE MULTISCALE AREA WHERE MODELS NEED TO DEAL WITH THE SCALE SEPARATION PROBLEM INHERENT IN NONSTEADY NONLINEAR FLOWS  WHILE ALSO TAKING IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDSMORE REALISTIC PHYSICS BY DEVELOPING MULTIFLUID DESCRIPTIONS.THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO IMPROVE MODELING OF THE SOLAR WIND  CORONA AND ENERGETIC PARTICLES IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE  AND TO DEVELOP THREE DELIVERABLES WITHIN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD: (1) THE CENTER PIECE OF THE PROJECT IS A MULTIFLUID SOLAR WIND CODE THAT WILL INCLUDE TURBULENCE MODELING. THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL (3D) SOLAR WIND CODE WILL BE BASED ON THE CURRENT USMANOV ET AL. CODE  BUT OPERATING BETWEEN 0.1 AU AND 1 AU  THAT IS OUTSIDE THE ALFV EN CRITICAL POINT TO THE EARTH. THE TURBULENCE MODEL  CURRENTLY OF THE REYNOLDS AVERAGED NAVIER-STOKES (RANS) TYPE  WILL BE EXPANDED AND IMPROVED TO INCLUDE A LARGE EDDY SIMULATION (LES) APPROACH AND SUBGRID-SCALE MODELING. THE MODEL WILL INCLUDE PROTON  ELECTRON AND HELIUM FLUIDS; 2) AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT BOTH FOR COMPLETENESS OF SPACE WEATHER MODELING  AND TO PROVIDE BOUNDARY DATA FOR THE SOLAR WIND CODE  IS A NEW 3D CORONAL CODE IN THE SUB-ALFV ENIC REGION  ALSO INCLUDING MULTIFLUIDS AND A TURBULENCE MODEL SPECIALIZED FOR CORONAL PLASMA CONDITIONS. THIS MODEL IS MORE EXPERIMENTAL IN NATURE AND WILL REQUIRE DEVELOPMENT IN STAGES; 3) THE FINAL COMPONENT  A TRANSPORT CODE FOR ENERGETIC PARTICLES  NOTABLY SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES  WILL INCLUDE A FOCUSED TRANSPORT MODEL ADAPTED TO THE DYNAMIC SIMULATION DATA FROM MODELS (1) AND (2). THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THESE MODELS WILL BE DESIGNED FOR INTEROPERABILITY INCLUDING INTERFACING WITH MODELS DEVELOPED ELSEWHERE. WE WILL ALSO WORK TOWARD INTEGRATION OF THE TRANSPORT CODE AND INTERPLANETARY CODES WITH GLOBAL MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC (MHD) MODELS OF THE MAGNETOSPHERE TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF SPACE WEATHER EVENTS ON MAGNETOSPHERIC DYNAMICS.BY BRINGING TOGETHER AN EXPERIENCED TEAM WITH EXPERTISE IN SOLAR WIND  CORONAL  AND MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS  HYDRODYNAMIC AND MHD TURBULENCE MODELING  AND LARGE SCALE TURBULENCE  CORONAL AND SOLAR WIND SIMULATIONS  IN COMBINATION WITH EXPERIENCE IN ANALYSIS OF SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS FOR VERIFICATION AND TESTING  WE EXPECT TO MAKE STEADY AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THIS CHALLENGING AREA  LEADING TO USEFUL DELIVERABLES WITHIN BOTH THREE AND FIVE YEAR PERIODS.

NASA'S CYCLONE GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM (CYGNSS) MISSION WILL PROVIDE A VITAL PIECE OF INFORMATION IN MJO DYNAMICS: NEAR SURFACE WINDS UNDER ALL WEATHER CONDITIONS  WITH A HIGH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION. THE WORK PROPOSED HEREIN WILL INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CYGNSS DATA ON SIMULATING THE STRUCTURE AND PROPAGATION OF MJO  USING BOTH A REGIONAL MODEL AND A CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL. SINCE CYGNSS WILL NOT BE LAUNCHED UNTIL 2016  WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH-QUALITY DATASET FROM THE RECENTLY FINISHED DYNAMICS OF THE MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION (DYNAMO  OCTOBER 1  2011 ~ FEBRUARY 8  2012) FIELD CAMPAIGN.THE PROPOSED REGIONAL MODEL FOR THIS STUDY IS THE COUPLED-OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE-WAVE-SEDIMENT TRANSPORT (COAWST) MODELING SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM COUPLES THE WEATHER RESEARCH AND FORECASTING (WRF; ATMOSPHERE) MODEL  THE SIMULATING WAVES NEARSHORE (SWAN; WAVE) MODEL AND THE REGIONAL OCEAN MODELING SYSTEM (ROMS; OCEAN) VIA THE MODEL COUPLING TOOLKIT (MCT). THE CLOUD RESOLVING MODEL IS THE GODDARD CUMULUS ENSEMBLE (GCE) MODEL. WE PLAN TO FOCUS ON THE TWO WELL-OBSERVED MJO EVENTS DURING DYNAMO CAMPAIGN PERIOD IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER  2011. THE FULLY COUPLED COAWST MODEL WILL BE USED TO SIMULATE THESE EVENTS AND THE SIMULATED STORM STRUCTURE  SURFACE FLUXES  SURFACE WIND AND WAVE HEIGHTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS DURING THE DYNAMO CAMPAIGN. THE FORWARD MODEL DEVELOPED BY CYGNSS TEAM WILL BE APPLIED TO THE SWAN WAVE MODEL OUTPUT IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SYNTHETIC CYGNSS DATA FOR GENERAL PRE-LAUNCH STUDIES. IN THIS PROPOSED STUDY  THIS DATASET WILL BE USED TO NUDGE THE NEAR SURFACE WINDS IN THE CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL IN ORDER TO STUDY IMPACT OF CYGNSS DATA ON MODEL RESULTS. THE SURFACE WIND AND AIR-SEA INTERACTIONS PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN MJO DEVELOPMENT AND PROPAGATION. THE COAWST MODELING SYSTEM AND THE GCE CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL EACH HAS ITS UNIQUE ABILITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THESE TOPICS. FOREXAMPLE  THE NESTED COAWST MODEL HAS A LARGE DOMAIN AND FULLY INTERACTIVE ATMOSPHERE  OCEAN  AND WAVE COMPONENTS. IT WILL BE USED TO STUDY HOW INCLUDING OCEAN/WAVE COMPONENT CAN AFFECT SIMULATED SURFACE FLUXES  LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE  AND WATER VAPOR BUDGET  AND HOW THESE FACTORS INFLUENCE MJO STRUCTURES AND STRENGTHS. THE HIGH-RESOLUTION GCE MODEL WILL BE USED TO STUDY THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ORGANIZED TROPICAL CONVECTION: THE INDIVIDUAL MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS. THE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON DYNAMICS OF CONVECTION AND ITS ASSOCIATED DOWNDRAFT  SURFACE OUTFLOW AND COLD POOL  AS WELL AS THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE OCEAN SURFACE EVAPORATION AND WAVE DRAG. THE DYNAMO DATA WILL PROVIDE GOOD CONSTRAINTS ON THESE MODEL SENSITIVITY STUDIES. FURTHERMORE  COAWST MODEL AND THE GCE MODEL SHARE THE SAME OCEAN SURFACE FLUX SCHEME. THIS SCHEME WILL BE IMPROVED USING DYNAMO CASES AND DATA. THE IMPROVED SURFACE FLUX SCHEME WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NASA UNIFIED WRF AND SENSITIVITY TESTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO: 1)USE NASA IMAGE DATA IN CONJUNCTION WITH ACTUAL FIELD/LABORATORY MEASURED SPECTRA OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERIALS TO TEST THEDETECTION LIMITS OF SELECTED ARTIFACT CLASSES (OBSIDIAN  CERAMICS AND MIDDEN)AT THE SUB-PIXEL SCALE BY APPLYING PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED THEORETICAL DETECTION LIMIT MODELING (AUTHOR 1992  AUTHOR ET AL 2003)  2)EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE THAT BACKGROUND  SEASONAL VEGETATION CHANGEAND OTHER ON-SITE CHANGES HAVE FOR THE DETECTABILITY OF THESE OBJECTS IN IMAGE DATA  3)ESTABLISH THE INSTRUMENTATION  SPATIAL SCALE  AND SPECTRAL BANDS NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE DETECTABILITY OF THESE OBJECTS  AND 4)TO TEST PREDICTIONS OF NEW LOCATIONS FOR ARTIFACTS AT SPECIFIC(SPATIAL) DENSITIES IN OTHER IMAGE SCENES AND GROUND TRUTH THESE PREDICTIONS. PRIOR RESEARCH BY THE PROPOSERS HAS SHOWN THAT OBSIDIAN AND POTTERY ARE THEORETICALLY DETECTABLE AT REALISTIC CONCENTRATIONS AT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES. CERTAIN ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERIALS SUCH AS POTTERY SHERDS AND OBSIDIAN HAVE CHARACTERISTIC SPECTRAL SIGNATURES INVISIBLE AND THERMAL INFRARED WAVELENGTHS. SITE MIDDEN MAY AS WELL. THE GROUND SURFACE AT ANY GIVEN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE IS COMPOSED OF A NUMBER OF ARTIFACTS AND/OR NATURAL MATERIALS  INCLUDING THE TARGET ARTIFACTS AND BACKGROUNDS COMPOSED OF SOIL  ROCK  AND VEGETATION.A SPECTRUM COLLECTED BY AN AIRBORNE/SPACEBORNE SENSOR IS A COMBINATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL SPECTRA OF THESE MATERIALS; AS THE PERCENT COMPOSITION OF A MATERIAL ON THE SURFACE INCREASES  ITS SPECTRAL REPRESENTATION IN THE MIXED SPECTRUM INCREASES.

THE NASA SPACE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP WILL FUND THE STUDENT'S RESEARCH INTO THE MODELING AND VERIFICATION OF FLOWS THAT ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF GENERIC SHAPES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CONCEPTS. THE KEY TECHNOLOGY OF THE WIND TUNNEL IS A SHAPE-MORPHING THROAT MADE FROM A WOVEN CERAMIC MATERIAL. THE SHAPE-MORPHINGTHROAT ALLOWS FOR THE AREA RATIO AND THUS MACH NUMBER TO BE VARIED. THE PARTICULAR DESIGN OF THE THROAT ALLOWS FOR BOTH SYMMETRIC FLOWS (WHERE ONLY THE INVISCID  VARIABLE MACH NUMBER CORE IS IMPORTANT) AND ASYMMETRIC FLOWS (WHERE BOUNDARY LAYER EFFECTS AND SHOCKWAVE INTERACTIONS ARE IMPORTANT).

FOR EXAMPLE  A SHAPE MORPHING FREE JET WIND TUNNEL MIGHT EMPLOY EITHER A LENTICULAR OR QUADRICORN SHAPED THROAT TO AVOID SLIDING SEALS. BOTH SYMMETRIC AND ASYMMETRIC FLOWS WILL BE INVESTIGATED. IN PARTICULAR  ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WILL BE SOUGHT: I) HOW ROBUST IS THE RESPONSE OF THE FLOW TO CHANGES IN THROAT SHAPE OR SIZE  THE EXPANSION CONTOUR AND THE LENGTH OF THE EXPANSION REGION? II) WHAT IS THE QUALITY OF THE FLOW STRUCTURES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THROAT SHAPE OR SIZE? III) HOW WELL DO THE MODELS PREDICT THE FLOW PROPERTIES AND ARE THERE DYNAMIC INSTABILITIES THAT OCCUR DUE TO PRESSURE VARIATIONSASSOCIATED WITH THE CUSP SHAPES INVOLVED? IV) IS IT POSSIBLE TO GENERATE HIGH QUALITY ASYMMETRIC FLOWS FROM AN ASYMMETRIC OPENING? METHODS/TECHNIQUES: THE STUDENT WILL DEVELOP THEORETICAL (ANALYTICAL) AND COMPUTATIONAL (COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS) MODELS OF THE FLOW FIELDDOWNSTREAM OF THE THROAT FOR PURPOSES OF PREDICTING THE FLOW FIELD S RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THROAT SHAPE AND SIZE.

SPECIFICALLY  WE PROPOSE TO EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFY IF THE CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) PHOTODISSOCIATION AT VACUUM ULTRAVIOLET (VUV) WAVELENGTHS (90-110 NM) WOULD PRODUCE THE EXPECTED MASS INDEPENDENT OXYGEN ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION AS PREDICTED IN THE RECENTLY REVIVED SELF-SHIELDING MODEL (CLAYTON 2002; YURIMOTO AND KURAMOTO  2004; LYONS AND YOUNG  2005).

WE DESCRIBE OUR DESIGN CONCEPT AND DEMONSTRATE OUR UNIQUE CAPABILITY TO PERFORM THIS TIMELYEXPERIMENT ON ALL MAJOR BANDS  WITH DATA OBTAINED FROM THE 105.17MN BAND (BAND 31) AS AN EXAMPLE. THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENT WILL BE PERFORMED IN VUV WAVELENGTH RANGE (90-110 NM). AN ULTRA-HIGH RESOLUTION VUV LASER WILL BE SENT ACROSS TWO SEPARATED MOLECULAR BEAMS IN SEQUENCE  THE FIRST ONE IS FOR ATTENUATION OF LIGHT (SHIELDING) BY CO ABSORPTION  AND THE SECOND ONE IS FOR FRAGMENTATIONOF CO BY PHOTODISSOCIATION.

DESPITE ITS IMPORTANCE AND ALL THE EFFORTS AIMED AT STUDYING IT  THERE ARE STILL MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ORIGIN  ACCELERATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR WIND. TWO FUNDAMENTAL OPEN QUESTIONS IN SOLAR WIND SCIENCE ARE: 1) WHERE DOES THE SOLAR WIND PLASMA COME FROM  I.E. FROM WHAT TYPE OF PLASMA STRUCTURES AND FROM WHAT REGIONS IN THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE  AND 2) HOW ISTHE SOLAR WIND HEATED AND ACCELERATED? WE PROPOSE TO DIRECTLY AND QUANTITATIVELY COMBINE HIGH-RESOLUTION OBSERVATIONS OF THE EUV EMISSION OF SOLAR CORONAL PLASMAS WITH IN-SITU PLASMA OBSERVATIONS OBTAINED DURING QUADRATURE BETWEEN ULYSSES  SOHO AND HINODE TO ACHIEVE THREE GOALS: 1) TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE REGIONS OF THE FAST AND SLOW SOLAR WIND; 2) TO PROVIDE AN EMPIRICAL DETERMINATION OF WIND PLASMA PARAMETERS AND HEATING; AND 3) TO DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE TOOL THAT USES EMPIRICAL OR MODEL WIND TEMPERATURE  DENSITY AND VELOCITY AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE FROM THE SUN TO PRODUCE DETAILED QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR WIND CHARGE STATE COMPOSITION. PREDICTED CHARGE STATES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE BOTH THE FINAL FROZEN-IN CHARGE STATES IN THE SOLAR WIND  AND THE X-RAY  EUV AND UV EMISSION OF THE WIND SOURCE REGIONS IN THE INNER CORONA. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF SPECTROSCOPIC AND IN SITU TECHNIQUES. WE WILL MEASURE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOLAR WIND SOURCE REGIONS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA FROM SOHO AND HINODE. WE WILL USE THE SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS OF PLASMA PARAMETERS AS INPUT TO THE IONCOMPOSITION MODEL  TOGETHER WITH AN ASSUMED PLASMA VELOCITY FUNCTION  TO PREDICT ION COMPOSITION AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE FROM THE WIND SOURCE REGION. THE ION COMPOSITION WILL BE USED TO 1) COMPARE FROZEN-IN CHARGE STATES WITH ULYSSES MEASUREMENTS AT ONE END OF THE SOLAR WIND TRAJECTORY  AND 2) CALCULATE LINE INTENSITIES AND NARROW-BAND IMAGES IN THE INNERMOST REGIONS OF THE SOLAR CORONA TO BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS FROM THE SPECTROMETERS ON BOARD SOHO AND HINODE AT THE OTHER END OF THE WIND TRAJECTORY. THIS DOUBLE COMPARISON WILL ALLOW US TO: 1) TEST THE ACCURACY OF THE IONIZATION MODEL'S PREDICTION  2) DIRECTLY TEST THE WIND PLASMA PARAMETERS (DENSITY  TEMPERATURE AND VELOCITY) USED AS INPUT TO THE IONIZATION MODEL; AND 3) DEVELOP AN EMPIRICAL MODEL OF THE PLASMA VELOCITY  ACCELERATION AND THERMAL HISTORY BELOW 1.5 SOLAR RADII.

HOWEVER  MUCH REMAINS UNKNOWN ABOUT MANY OF THESE OSCILLATIONS; THEY ARE INTERMITTENT FOR UNKNOWN REASONS  APPEAR ON SOME CORONAL FEATURES AND NOT ON OTHER  SIMILAR  NEIGHBORING FEATURES  AND MAY (OR MAY NOT) BE MAGNETOHYRODYNAMIC WAVE MODES. DEFINITIVE CAUSES OF THE STRUCTURE AND ORIGINS OF THESE OSCILLATIONS IS STILL LARGELY LACKING. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY HOW AND WHY FEATURESIN THE CORONA OSCILLATE  AND IF THEY OSCILLATE AS IDENTIFIABLE WAVE MODES. WE WILL MAKE USE OF AUTOMATED DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF SDO-AIA DATA AVAILABLE. FIRST  WE WILL MEASURE THE OSCILLATION CONTENT OFDIFFERENT PHYSICAL REGIONS ON THE SUN IN SDO AIA DATA. WE WILL DO THIS USING THREE DIFFERENT AUTOMATED OSCILLATION DETECTION ALGORITHMS (DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY) TO VALIDATE THE RESULTS. THE MEASURED OSCILLATION CONTENT WILL BE CORRELATED WITH OTHER MEASURES OF THOSE REGIONS SUCH AS AREA  TOTAL UNSIGNED MAGNETIC FLUX  AND AGE TO OBTAIN BASIC INFORMATION ON THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR AN OSCILLATION TO OCCUR  BASIC INFORMATION THAT HAS  AS YET  NOT BEEN OBTAINED. WE WILL EXTRACT ALL THIS CONTENT IN EACH AIA PASSBAND. FURTHER  WEWILL ROUTINELY MEASURE THE CORONAL OSCILLATION CONTENT OF THE SUN IN THE CURRENT SOLAR CYCLE  AND PROVIDE THOSE MEASUREMENTS ONLINE. SECOND  WE NEED TO KNOW THE PHYSICAL SIZE OF THE COHERENT OSCILLATING STRUCTURE AND WHAT KIND OF STRUCTURE THE OSCILLATIONS OCCUR ON. WE WILL DO THIS BY IMPLEMENTING PIXEL GROUPING AND OSCILLATORY SIGNAL COHERENCE ALGORITHMS TO DETECT COHERENTLY OSCILLATING STRUCTURES. FURTHER  WE WILL DEVELOP A 3D WAVELET ALGORITHM AND A CURVELET-BASED TEXTURE ANALYSIS THAT CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NARROW AND EXTENDED CURVILINEAR FEATURES  SUCH AS CORONAL LOOPS  AND NON-LOOP EMISSION ON THE SUN. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY LOOP-LIKE FEATURES AT MULTIPLE LENGTH-SCALES (LARGE LOOPS IN ACTIVE REGIONS  SMALL LOOPS IN CORONAL HOLES AND QUIET SUN)  AND OTHER TYPES OF EMISSION  SUCH AS PLAGE OR MOSS IN EACH AIA PASSBAND. THIRD  WE WILL STUDY OF ORIGINS OF LONGITUDINAL OSCILLATIONS AND FLARE-INDUCED KINK WAVES. THE COMBINATION OF AUTOMATED DETECTION OF THE OSCILLATIONS  AND THE STRUCTURE SUPPORTING THESE OSCILLATIONS  AS MEASURED IN EACH OF THE SDO PASSBANDS  WILL ALLOW US TO TEST THEORIES OF OSCILLATION PROPAGATION  CORONAL HEATING  AND ENERGY DECAY MECHANISMS IN THE SOLARATMOSPHERE.

HOWEVER  RECENT ACCIDENT DATA [1] INDICATES A TREND IN THE WRONG DIRECTION  PARTICULARLY AMONG INTERNATIONAL OPERATORS. A NUMBER OF RECENT ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED WITH HIGHLY AUTOMATED MODERN AIRCRAFT WHERE FLIGHT CREWS EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF ATTITUDE STATE AWARENESS (LASA) AND/OR A LOSS OF ENERGY STATE AWARENESS (LESA). THE RECENT AIR FRANCE 447 ACCIDENT (5/31/2009) IS A STARK EXAMPLE OF AN ACCIDENT DUE TO LESA DESPITE ENVELOPE PROTECTION AND A WELL-TRAINED CREW.

AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF MATERIAL DESIGN ARE COMPLEX MATERIALS: HYBRIDS  COMPOSITES  AND ALLOYS WHOSE CONSTITUENTSAND PROCESSING DETAILS CAN LEAD TO A WIDE RANGE OF PROPERTIES. THE DESIGN OF A COMPLEX MATERIAL CAN BE FOCUSED TOWARDS SPECIFIC OR MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS  AND TAILORED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A GIVEN MISSION.HYBRID MATERIALS ARE DEFINED BY TWO DISTINCT CONSTITUENTS MIXED AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL  USUALLY AN INORGANIC PHASE INTERMIXED WITH LARGE ORGANIC MOLECULES. THE FIELD OF NANOCOMPOSITES INTERSECTS SOMEWHAT WITH THE FIELD OF HYBRID MATERIALS  THOUGH COMPOSITE MATERIALS ARE TYPICALLY DISTINGUISHED BY LARGER SPATIAL SEPARATION BETWEEN CONSTITUENTS. COMPLEX MATERIALS MAY OFFER THE PROPERTIES OFTWO DIFFERENT MATERIALS IN PARALLEL  WITH ADDITIONAL EFFECTS DUE TO CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS. FURTHERMORE  ALLOYS AND HYBRIDS CAN FORM THE CONSTITUENTS OF ADVANCED COMPOSITES. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE EXTREMELY NUMEROUS IN DESIGNING COMPLEX MATERIALS  TO THE EXTENT THATEXPERIMENTAL TRIAL AND ERROR BECOMES IMPRACTICAL AND COSTLY. WE PROPOSE THAT MATERIAL SIMULATION TECHNIQUES MAY HAVE MUCH TO OFFER IN THE DESIGN OF COMPLEX MATERIALS  FROM HIGH-THROUGHPUT MATERIAL SELECTION TO DETAILED OBSERVATION OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES IN A GIVEN ENVIRONMENT.HERE  WE FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATOMISTIC (ATOM-BY-ATOM) MODELS FOR COMPLEX MATERIALS IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. EMPIRICAL MODELS  IN WHICH ATOMS ARE ASSUMED TO EXHIBIT PARAMETERIZED INTERATOMIC POTENTIALS  OFTEN LACK THE TRANSFERABILITY NECESSARY TO EXPLORE EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE TYPICALLY FIT TO A SET OF PROPERTIES WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELIABLE OUTSIDE OF THE RANGE OF FITTING. FOR THIS REASON  IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPLOY QUANTUM MECHANICAL METHODS AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER  COMPLEX MATERIAL SYSTEMS NATURALLY REQUIRE A LARGE NUMBER OF ATOMS TO CONSTRUCT A REPRESENTATIVE UNIT  PRESENTING A PROBLEM FOR QUANTUM METHODS IN WHICH COMPUTATION TIME SCALES AT BEST QUADRATICALLY WITH SYSTEM SIZE.DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY (DFT) CALCULATIONS HAVE BECOME WIDELY UTILIZED IN MATERIAL SIMULATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR REMARKABLE ABILITY TO REPRODUCE MEASURED QUANTITIES. DFT CALCULATIONS ARE LIMITED TO A FEW HUNDRED ATOMS ON A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SYSTEM. THIS MAY BE ENOUGH TO STUDY THE GROUND STATE PROPERTIES OF COMPLEX MATERIAL SYSTEMS  BUT DFT IS KNOWN TO MISREPRESENT CERTAIN INTERACTIONS THAT ARE LIKELY RELEVANT TO THE PROBLEM OF COMPLEX MATERIALS DESIGN  SUCH AS VAN DER WAALS (VDW) BONDING. EMPIRICAL EXTENSIONS TO DFT ARE COMMONLY EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE RESOLUTION OF SUCH MISREPRESENTED EFFECTS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE EMPIRICAL CORRECTIONS TO QUANTUM MODELS AND/OR APPLICATION OF KNOWN MACROSCOPIC PROPERTIES TO SHRINK THE REPRESENTATIVE UNIT FOR ATOMISTIC CALCULATIONS. SUCH APPROXIMATIONSWILL CERTAINLY BE NECESSARY TO APPROACH THE PROBLEM OF MODELING COMPLEX MATERIALS  ESPECIALLY IN CONSIDERATION OF TIME-DEPENDENT PROCESSES IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS.WE CONSIDER ONE IMPORTANT APPLICATION IN SPACE TECHNOLOGY: DESIGN OF HYBRID MATERIALS FOR THERMALLY PROTECTIVE ABLATORS DURING ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY. ENGINEERED HYBRID MATERIALS ARE ATTRACTIVE FOR THIS APPLICATION  AS THERE WILL BE A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR A GIVEN ASCENT. MECHANICAL STABILITY AND PRECISELY TUNED ABLATION CHARACTERISTICS ARE DESIRABLE  AND THERE IS POTENTIAL TO ENGINEER ENHANCED OPTICAL PROPERTIES (AT ATOMIC AS WELL AS PHOTONIC SCALES) TO REDUCE RADIATIVE HEATING. THE ACTUAL THERMAL  MECHANICAL  AND OPTICAL DESIGN GOALS WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE ATMOSPHERE AND VEHICLE OF INTEREST.

THESE GPS NETWORKS ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME. THEY ARE USED PRIMARILY FOR POSITIONING AND TO PROVIDE PRECISE ORBITS FOR MANY NASA SATELLITE AND AIRBORNE MISSIONS. IT HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED THAT DATA FROM THESE SAME SITES CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE INTEGRATED MEASUREMENTS OF WATER VAPOR AND TOTAL ELECTRON CONTENT  THUS MAKING GPS A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ATMOSPHERE. MORE RECENTLY IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THESE SAME GPS GROUND NETWORKS  IF PROPERLY SITED  PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE LAND SURFACE SURROUNDING THE GPS ANTENNA  IN THE FORM OF SOIL MOISTURE  SNOW DEPTH  AND BIOMASS PRODUCTS. THE BENEFIT OF REFLECTION DATA DERIVED FROM GPS GROUND NETWORKS FOR HYDROLOGICAL STUDIES WOULD BE THREE-FOLD. FIRST  BY USING NETWORKS THAT ALREADY EXIST AND HAVE SUPPORT FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES  NASA WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE USEFUL SCIENTIFIC DATA AT LOW COST. SECONDLY  THE FOOTPRINT OF A GROUND GPS SITE IS INTERMEDIATE TO IN SITU PROBES AND SATELLITE SENSORS. THE FORMER (10S OF CMS) FAILS TO CAPTURE THE TRUE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THE HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETER WHILE THE LATER IS OFTEN TOO LARGE (10S OF KMS). ASSIMILATION MODELS THAT INCLUDE BOTH IN SITU AND SATELLITE DATA CAN BE IMPROVED BY HAVING SUCH AN INTERMEDIATE-SCALE SENSOR. FINALLY  HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENT  AS SOIL MOISTURE DATA ARE USED IN WEATHER FORECASTS AND CLIMATE MODELS. SNOWPACK AND MELT RATE INFORMATION ARE NEEDED FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER SUPPLY AND FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEMS  PARTICULARLY IN THE MORE ARID WESTERN U.S. ESTIMATES OF BIOMASS/VEGETATION STATE ARE ALSO REQUIRED FOR ASSIMILATION MODELS AND FOR VALIDATION OF SATELLITE SURVEYS OF LAND SURFACE CONDITIONS. WHILE THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP NEW HYDROLOGICAL PRODUCTS FROM GPS REFLECTION DATA  KNOWLEDGE OF HYDROLOGICAL SIGNALS IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING POSITIONING ACCURACY OF GPS. THE LATTER IS A KEY DRIVER IN THE ACCURACY OF THE INTERNATIONAL TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME. GIVEN THE MATURITY OF GPS NETWORKS  IT IS APPROPRIATE NOW TO USE MODELS  SUCH AS GLDAS (GLOBAL LAND DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM)  TO DEVELOP HYDROLOGICAL LOADING CORRECTIONS FOR GPS NETWORKS. TOGETHER WITH ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING EFFECTS  GPS VERTICAL PRECISION CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. THIS RESEARCH WILL SUPPORT NASA MISSIONS SUCH AS GRACE AND DESDYNI. ITS RELEVANCE TO THE ADVANCED GEODETIC CONCEPTS NRA INCLUDES THE CALL FOR NEW MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES FOR GPS REFLECTIONS. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL ASSEMBLE A COLLECTION OF DATA SETS DERIVED FROM GPS NETWORKS FOR DIRECT USE IN EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE STUDIES. THE PRIMARY NETWORK USED IN THIS STUDY WILL BE THE EARTHSCOPE PLATE BOUNDARY OBSERVATORY (PBO) BUILT BY NSF IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA AND THE USGS. THIS STUDY WILL YIELD A (1) DATABASE OF SNOW DEPTH (AND SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT)  (2) DATABASE OF BIOMASS  (3) ANCILLARY ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SETS OF PRECIPITATION  TEMPERATURE  AND VEGETATION PRODUCTS (4) HYDROLOGICAL LOADING EFFECTS  (5) ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING EFFECTS AND (6) TEST THE ABILITY OF THESE PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE AND UNDERSTAND HOW HYDROLOGICAL FORCING INFLUENCES GLDAS.

HOWEVER  OFTENTIMES CFD CAN ONLY BE USED WITH CONFIDENCE AT NEAR DESIGN CONDITIONS WHERE THE FLOW IS MOSTLY ATTACHED. THE ABILITY TO RELIABLY PREDICT FLOW SEPARATION  INCLUDING SEPARATION ONSET AND PROGRESSION  HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE MAJORIMPEDIMENTS TO MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN CYCLE. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THIS CAPABILITY WILL ENABLE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF COMPLEX FLOW PHYSICS DRIVING IMPORTANT DESIGN METRICS  WHICH IN TURN WILL ENABLE MORE AGGRESSIVE DESIGNS AT LOWER RISK. NEW CONCEPTS AND CONFIGURATIONS OFTEN RELY ON DIFFERENT FLOW PHYSICS THAT PROGRAMS MUST BE ABLE TO SIMULATE WITH CONFIDENCE IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE DESIGNS AND REDUCE RISK. AT THE SAME TIME  SIMULATIONS FOR TRADITIONAL FIXED WING CONFIGURATIONS ARE SEVERELY LACKING IN CRITICAL REGIONS OF THE FLIGHT REGIME SUCH AS NEAR STALL  AT HIGH-LIFT CONDITIONS  IN DEFLECTED CONTROL SURFACE CONDITIONS AND AT THE EDGES OF THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE. IN ALL THESE CASES  THE ABILITY TO EXPAND THE USE OF CFD TO A WIDER VARIETY OF CONFIGURATIONS AND THROUGH ALL REGIONS OF THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE WILL GREATLY IMPACT ALL THE IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE METRICS SUCH AS DRAG  FUEL BURN AND EMISSIONS  ACOUSTICS  FLOW CONTROL  HIGH LIFT EFFECTIVENESS  AND STABILITY AND CONTROL.THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A CAPABILITY FOR ACCURATELY PREDICTING AERODYNAMIC FLOWS OVER REALISTIC AND COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS INVOLVING SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF FLOW SEPARATION.

BY RESOLVING A LARGER PORTION OF THE TURBULENCE SPECTRA  TECHNIQUES SUCH AS LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION (LES) OFFER THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE UNIVERSALLY ACCURATE MODELS APPLICABLE TO A WIDER RANGE OF SEPARATED FLOWS. HOWEVER  EXISTING LES METHODS FACE THREE BASIC PROBLEMS: A HUGE VARIETY OFLES MODELS ARE CURRENTLY APPLIED  DYNAMIC LES METHODS ARE EITHER VERY EXPENSIVE OR HAVE TO BE COMBINED WITH FLOW-DEPENDENT EMPIRICAL STABILIZATION TECHNIQUES  AND THE COST OF LES FOR WALL-BOUNDED FLOW SIMULATIONS ARE WAY TOO HIGH FOR MOST APPLICATIONS. A SOLUTION APPROACH FOR THESE THREE PROBLEMS WAS RECENTLY SUGGESTED BY THE PI. BY USING A STOCHASTIC TURBULENCE MODEL HE DEVELOPED A HIERARCHY OF REALIZABLE LES MODELS  CORRESPONDING DYNAMIC LES METHODS THAT OVER-COME THE STABILITY PROBLEMS OF EXISTING DYNAMICLES METHODS  AND UNIFIED RANS-LES MODELS THAT ENABLE A HUGE COMPUTATIONAL COST REDUCTION BY A FACTOR OF 5.7 RE^0.42 (RE REFERS TO THE REYNOLDS NUMBER). THESE NEW UNIFIED AND DYNAMIC LES METHODS HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES COMPARED TO EXISTING METHODS. ON THE OTHER HAND  THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THESE METHODS DO NOT REPRESENT THE FINAL ANSWER TO THE THREE LES PROBLEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE BECAUSE OF THEIR DEFICIENCIES IN ACCURATELY REPRESENTING THE SPATIOTEMPORAL STRUCTURE OF TURBULENT FLOWS. THE FIRST SPECIFIC PROJECT GOAL IS TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REALIZABLE STOCHASTIC TURBULENCE MODEL THAT PRESERVES THE SPACE-TIME STRUCTURE OF TURBULENCE  AND TO USE THIS MODEL FOR THE DERIVATION OF HIERARCHICAL LES  DYNAMIC LES  AND UNIFIED RANS-LES METHODS. THE SECOND SPECIFIC PROJECT GOAL IS TO SHOW THE SUCCESS OF DYNAMIC LES AND UNIFIED RANS-LES METHODS THROUGH APPLICATIONS INVOLVING FLOW SEPARATION.

FOR SEVERAL WET AND DRY YEARS  WE WILL ASSEMBLE A SET OF PRODUCTS AND THEIR VALIDATION DATASETS. THE VALIDATION DATA WILL INCLUDE A COMPREHENSIVE (~1000) SET OF LANDSAT SCENES  AUGMENTED AT SOME LOCATIONS AND TIMES BY HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA (DIGITIZED AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS  QUICKBIRD IMAGER  AND DECLASSIFIED IMAGES FROM NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE SATELLITES) FROM WHICH ACCURATE BINARY MAPS OF SNOW COVER CAN BE CREATED. WE WILL VALIDATE SNOW IN THE FORESTS WITH EXISTING LIDAR SNOW SURVEY DATA  TO CHARACTERIZE SNOW DEPTH VARIABILITY AT SUB-METER SCALES  INCLUDING SUB-CANOPY AREAS. WE WILL USE ALSO USE EXISTING ULTRASONIC SNOW DEPTH SENSORS TO CHARACTERIZE SNOW ACCUMULATION  MELT  AND DURATION IN OPEN  CANOPY-EDGE  AND SUB-CANOPY CONDITIONS.

DURING PERSISTENT CLOUD COVER  THE ONLY VIEW OF THE GROUND FOR A WEEK OR TWO MIGHT WELL BE AT SUCH A HIGHLY OBLIQUE ANGLE. TO EVALUATE FRACTIONAL SNOW COVER IN THOSE SITUATIONS  WE WILL USE LANDSAT TM OR ETM+ SCENES THAT COINCIDE WITH THE EDGES OF SNOW-COVERED MODIS IMAGES. WE WILL COMPARE TIME-SPACE SMOOTHING AND INTERPOLATION TO A SEQUENCE OF LANDSAT TM OR ETM+ SCENES OVER THE SIERRA NEVADA FROM 2000 TO PRESENT  FOCUSING ESPECIALLY ON LOCATIONS AND TIMES WHEN THE SMOOTHED AND INTERPOLATED PRODUCT DIFFERS FROM THE RAW MODIS FRACTIONAL SNOW COVER. WE WILL VALIDATE BOTH THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUITY PRODUCT'S PREDICTIVE MODE (ESTIMATE SNOW-COVER ON A GIVEN DAY USING ONLY DATA PRIOR TO THAT DAY) AND ITS RETROSPECTIVE MODE (RECONSTRUCT THE HISTORY OF SNOW PROPERTIES FOR A PRIOR PERIOD.) WE HAVE ACCESS TO SNOW ALBEDO DATA AND COINCIDENT AVIRIS IMAGERY FROM FIELD SITES AT THE SENATOR BECK BASIN IN THE SAN JUAN MOUNTAINS  COLORADO AND AT MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN IN THE SIERRA NEVADA  CALIFORNIA. WE WILL USE THESE DATA TO VALIDATE AVIRIS-DERIVED SNOW ALBEDO  AND THEN COINCIDENT AVIRIS/MODIS DATA TO VALIDATE MODIS-DERIVED ALBEDO. THE MODIS CLOUD PRODUCT CONTAINS ERRORS OF BOTH OMISSION AND COMMISSION  AND ALL MODIS SNOW PRODUCTS SOMETIMES CONFUSE CLOUDS AND SNOW. THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUITY PRODUCT ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT THIS BY FORCING SNOW THAT IS TOO FINE-GRAINED AND COVERS THE WHOLE PIXEL TO BE CLASSIFIED AS CLOUD  WHILE CLOUDS THAT ARE TOO COARSE-GRAINED ARE CLASSIFIED AS SNOW. WE WILL VALIDATE THIS APPROACH USING LANDSAT TM AND ETM+  WHICH CAN IDENTIFY CLOUDS BOTH BY TEXTURE AND BY SNOW/CLOUD CONTRAST IN BAND 5.

TRACKING SYSTEM'S ABILITY TO PREPARE FOR  AND TO PROVIDE EARLY WARNING TO  POPULATIONS AT RISK. THE THREE PRIMARY TASKS ARE TO: (1) ASSIMILATE PRODUCTS FROM NASA SATELLITE SENSORS INTO EPA'S COMMUNITY MULTI-SCALE AIR QUALITY (CMAQ) MODEL AND THE DUST REGIONAL ATMOSPHERIC MODEL (DREAM). FOR HUMAN HEALTH APPLICATIONS  THESE INCLUDE (A) BI-MONTHLY LAND COVER CHARACTERIZATIONS DERIVED FROM MODIS DATA THAT ARE AVAILABLE DAILY FROM BOTH THE TERRA AND AQUA OBSERVATORIES; (B) MODIS AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH MEASUREMENTS FROM TERRA AND AQUA; AND  (C) AEROSOL PROFILE PRODUCTS FROM CALIPSO AND GLORY; (2) VERIFY AND VALIDATE MODEL OUTPUTS AND ASSESS IMPROVEMENTS TO OZONE  DUST  AND OTHER AEROSOL FORECASTS; (3) ENHANCE EPHTS AND EPHTN DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS WITH MODEL OUTPUTS AND FORECASTS. BI-MONTHLY INPUTS OF LAND COVER THAT INCLUDES A BARREN LAND CATEGORY WILL HELP CMAQ AND DREAM TO SIMULATE DESERT DUST PRODUCTION AND BIOGENICALLY EMITTED CHEMICALS SUCH AS ISOPRENE AND MONOTERPENES. IN ADDITION  SATELLITE AEROSOL MEASUREMENTS WILL HELP SET MORE REALISTIC INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE MODELS. THIS PROJECT ENGINEERS A NEW COURSE FOR INCORPORATING SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF AEROSOLS AND LAND COVER CHANGE DATA INTO FORECAST MODELS THAT SUPPORT HEALTH DECISIONS. TO TEST THE TWO TASKS AND TRANSITION OUTPUTS TO EPHTS AND EPHTN  THE PROJECT WILL COLLABORATE WITH NEW MEXICO'S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND CDC'S ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH TRACKING PROGRAM. BENEFITS ARE: (1) INCORPORATING EARTH SCIENCE RESULTS FOR HEALTH CARE AND DECISION MAKING IN RESPIRATORY DISEASE DIAGNOSES AND SURVEILLANCE; (2) IMPROVING COST EFFECTIVENESS OF INPATIENT HEALTH CARE BY PROVIDING 36-48 HOUR FORECASTS THAT ASSIST DECISIONS FOR HOSPITAL STAFFING  DIAGNOSIS  AND TREATMENT; AND  (3) EXPANDING THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN EARLIER AIR QUALITY/HEALTH EFFORTS TO AN ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY MODEL IN THE PM2.5 AND FINER SIZE RANGES.\",\"Start Date\":\"2008-03-28\",\"End Date\":null,\"Award Amount\":1242016.99,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX08AL15G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49195478,\"Award ID\":\"NNX08AI45G\",\"Recipient Name\":\"UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO\",\"Description\":\"CHLORINE ISOTOPE DISTRIBUTION IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES: SEARCH FOR MULTIPLE NEBULAR RESERVOIRSWE COMBINE THE DIVERSE EXPERTISE OF THREE P.I.S (MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY  PLANETARY MATERIALS  ELEMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND STABLE ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY) TO USE A NOVEL GEOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUE TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE PRIMARY NASA ORIGINS OBJECTIVES  \\\"STRATEGIC SUB-GOAL 3 RELATING TO THE FORMATION OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\\\". WE PROPOSE TO ANALYZE THE CHLORINE ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF A DIVERSE SUITE OF CARBONACEOUS  ORDINARY AND ENSTATITE CHONDRITES IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE DEGREE OF CL ISOTOPE HETEROGENEITY OF THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA. CHLORINE IS AN UNUSUAL ELEMENT IN THAT EQUILIBRIUM ISOTOPE FRACTIONATIONS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL AND THE NUMBER OF NEBULAR PHASES THAT CONTAIN CHLORINE IS VERY LIMITED. THEREFORE FRACTIONATION (OR A LACK THEREOF) OF CL ISOTOPES BETWEEN METEORITE TYPES AND/OR INDIVIDUAL PHASES CAN PLACE PROFOUND CONSTRAINTS ON EARLY NEBULAR CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE  HCL AND NACL ARE CONSIDERED AS MAJOR CL-BEARING HIGH-T PHASES IN THE EARLY NEBULA. THE CL ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION BETWEEN THEM IS LARGE ENOUGH SO THAT RAYLEIGH FRACTIONATION PROCESSES COULD CONTRIBUTE TO LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE CL ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF DIFFERENT PHASES. IF  HOWEVER  ONLY ONE OF THESE TWO GASES WAS PREVALENT  THEN NO ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION COULD HAVE OCCURRED. WE WILL ANALYZE WATER-SOLUBLE CL AND INSOLUBLE RESIDUE FROM BULK CHONDRITE SAMPLES USING A HIGH-SENSITIVITY MICRO-ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE DEVELOPED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO. ONLY 20 MICROGRAMS OF CL ARE NEEDED FOR AN ANALYSIS  MAKING ANALYSES OF RARE METEORITES FEASIBLE. WE WILL ALSO MAKE IN SITU ANALYSES OF WELL CHARACTERIZED CL-BEARING PHASES  SODALITE  APATITE  AND GLASS USING THE UCLA CAMECA IONPROBE. WE WILL USE SODALITE  APATITE AND SYNTHETIC GLASS STANDARDS  DEVELOPED IN OUR FACILITY  TO AVOID INSTRUMENT FRACTIONATIONS. IN OUR ORIGINAL WORK (NATURE 446  1062-1065)  WE FOUND THAT THE SODALITE IN ALLENDE CHONDRITE WAS OVER 1 PER MIL LIGHTER THAN THE BULK SAMPLE. IF  UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION  THESE DATA ARE CONFIRMED  IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE WAS AN EARLY  HIGH TEMPERATURE FRACTIONATION BETWEEN NACL (GAS) AND HCL (GAS)  PRESENT IN SUB-EQUAL AMOUNTS THAT RESULTED IN TWO DISTINCT CL RESERVOIRS. BY ANALYZING A DIVERSE SUITE OF METEORITES  WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN CL ISOTOPE VALUES AND OTHER GEOCHEMICAL INDICATORS  SUCH AS 17-O ANOMALIES. THREE YEARS OF FUNDING ARE REQUESTED  FORMING THE MAJOR PART OF A GRADUATE STUDENT'S THESIS. AFTER HAVING SPENT SEVERAL YEARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING  WE HAVE ARRIVED AT A POINT WHERE CL ISOTOPE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE RAPIDLY  ON SMALL AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL  AND WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY. BY STUDYING A LARGE NUMBER OF PRIMITIVE CHONDRITIC METEORITES  WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE THE FULL RANGE OF CL ISOTOPE VARIATION IN THIS GROUP  AND TO EVALUATE THE DATA IN TERMS OF PETROLOGIC TYPE  WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING CL-BEARING PHASE RELATIONS IN THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA.\",\"Start Date\":\"2008-05-01\",\"End Date\":null,\"Award Amount\":221998.07,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX08AI45G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49193805,\"Award ID\":\"NNX07AH53G\",\"Recipient Name\":\"THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO\",\"Description\":\"BEYOND THE COOL CORES IN GALAXY CLUSTERS: TESTING A HIERARCHICAL MODEL WITH X-RAY OBSERVATIONS AND A\",\"Start Date\":\"2007-04-05\",\"End Date\":\"2012-05-29\",\"Award Amount\":332700.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":null,\"Funding Sub Agency\":null,\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX07AH53G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49191818,\"Award ID\":\"NNA09DA76A\",\"Recipient Name\":\"THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY\",\"Description\":\"TITLE: SIGNATURES OF LIFE FROM EARTH AND BEYOND IS IN RESPONSE TO CAN #NNH08ZDA002C  NASA ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE  -  CYCLE 5  BASIC AWARD FOR CYCLE FIVE OF NAI TO PENN STATE.1260.51 COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT SPECIAL CONDITION.

THE GENERAL GOALS OF UNDERSTANDING HELIOSPHERIC PHYSICS AND THE SPECIFIC GOALS OF SPACE WEATHER STUDIES  MUST DEAL AT SOME LEVEL WITH ALL OF THESE MULTI-SCALE  MULTI-REGIONAL AND MULTI-PHYSICS CHALLENGES. A GRAND CHALLENGE OBJECTIVE OF THE LIVING WITH A STAR (LWS) AND SPACE WEATHER IS TO ATTAIN  SUN-TO-MUD  DYNAMICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF STEADY AND TRANSIENT CONDITIONS. EXISTING EFFORTS HAVE GENERALLY SIMPLIFIED THE MULTI-SCALE AND MULTIPHYSICS ASPECTS IN ORDER TO ATTAIN MULTI-REGIONAL RESULTS.THE PREMISE OF THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IS THAT TO MOVE FORWARD  SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED IN THE MULTISCALE AREA WHERE MODELS NEED TO DEAL WITH THE SCALE SEPARATION PROBLEM INHERENT IN NONSTEADY NONLINEAR FLOWS  WHILE ALSO TAKING IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDSMORE REALISTIC PHYSICS BY DEVELOPING MULTIFLUID DESCRIPTIONS.THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO IMPROVE MODELING OF THE SOLAR WIND  CORONA AND ENERGETIC PARTICLES IN THE INNER HELIOSPHERE  AND TO DEVELOP THREE DELIVERABLES WITHIN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD: (1) THE CENTER PIECE OF THE PROJECT IS A MULTIFLUID SOLAR WIND CODE THAT WILL INCLUDE TURBULENCE MODELING. THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL (3D) SOLAR WIND CODE WILL BE BASED ON THE CURRENT USMANOV ET AL. CODE  BUT OPERATING BETWEEN 0.1 AU AND 1 AU  THAT IS OUTSIDE THE ALFV EN CRITICAL POINT TO THE EARTH.

THE WORK PROPOSED HEREIN WILL INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CYGNSS DATA ON SIMULATING THE STRUCTURE AND PROPAGATION OF MJO  USING BOTH A REGIONAL MODEL AND A CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL. SINCE CYGNSS WILL NOT BE LAUNCHED UNTIL 2016  WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH-QUALITY DATASET FROM THE RECENTLY FINISHED DYNAMICS OF THE MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION (DYNAMO  OCTOBER 1  2011 ~ FEBRUARY 8  2012) FIELD CAMPAIGN.THE PROPOSED REGIONAL MODEL FOR THIS STUDY IS THE COUPLED-OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE-WAVE-SEDIMENT TRANSPORT (COAWST) MODELING SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM COUPLES THE WEATHER RESEARCH AND FORECASTING (WRF; ATMOSPHERE) MODEL  THE SIMULATING WAVES NEARSHORE (SWAN; WAVE) MODEL AND THE REGIONAL OCEAN MODELING SYSTEM (ROMS; OCEAN) VIA THE MODEL COUPLING TOOLKIT (MCT). THE CLOUD RESOLVING MODEL IS THE GODDARD CUMULUS ENSEMBLE (GCE) MODEL. WE PLAN TO FOCUS ON THE TWO WELL-OBSERVED MJO EVENTS DURING DYNAMO CAMPAIGN PERIOD IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER  2011. THE FULLY COUPLED COAWST MODEL WILL BE USED TO SIMULATE THESE EVENTS AND THE SIMULATED STORM STRUCTURE  SURFACE FLUXES  SURFACE WIND AND WAVE HEIGHTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS DURING THE DYNAMO CAMPAIGN.

IN THIS PROPOSED STUDY  THIS DATASET WILL BE USED TO NUDGE THE NEAR SURFACE WINDS IN THE CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL IN ORDER TO STUDY IMPACT OF CYGNSS DATA ON MODEL RESULTS. THE SURFACE WIND AND AIR-SEA INTERACTIONS PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN MJO DEVELOPMENT AND PROPAGATION. THE COAWST MODELING SYSTEM AND THE GCE CLOUD-RESOLVING MODEL EACH HAS ITS UNIQUE ABILITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THESE TOPICS.

IT WILL BE USED TO STUDY HOW INCLUDING OCEAN/WAVE COMPONENT CAN AFFECT SIMULATED SURFACE FLUXES  LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE  AND WATER VAPOR BUDGET  AND HOW THESE FACTORS INFLUENCE MJO STRUCTURES AND STRENGTHS. THE HIGH-RESOLUTION GCE MODEL WILL BE USED TO STUDY THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ORGANIZED TROPICAL CONVECTION: THE INDIVIDUAL MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS. THE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON DYNAMICS OF CONVECTION AND ITS ASSOCIATED DOWNDRAFT  SURFACE OUTFLOW AND COLD POOL  AS WELL AS THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE OCEAN SURFACE EVAPORATION AND WAVE DRAG. THE DYNAMO DATA WILL PROVIDE GOOD CONSTRAINTS ON THESE MODEL SENSITIVITY STUDIES. FURTHERMORE  COAWST MODEL AND THE GCE MODEL SHARE THE SAME OCEAN SURFACE FLUX SCHEME. THIS SCHEME WILL BE IMPROVED USING DYNAMO CASES AND DATA. THE IMPROVED SURFACE FLUX SCHEME WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NASA UNIFIED WRF AND SENSITIVITY TESTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT.

TECHNICAL APPROACH: THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON MODIS AND SEAWIFS OBSERVATIONS  AND THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES WILL BE USED TO ACHIEVE THE 4 OBJECTIVES  RESPECTIVELY: 1. STATISTICS OF BRIGHT-TARGET ADJACENCY EFFECTS UNDER VARIOUS SCENARIOS FOR EACH SENSOR AND DETECTOR WILL BE GENERATED AND STORED IN LOOKUP TABLES (LUTS); 2. TWO METHODS WILL BE USED FOR THE CORRECTION OF THE BRIGHT-TARGET ADJACENCY EFFECTS OVER WATER.

THE APPLIED PHYSICS GROUP AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY WILL BE PROVIDINGADVISORY SUPPORT FOR COMPUTATIONAL MODELING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF FREE JET WIND TUNNEL CONCEPTS. THE NASA SPACE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP WILL FUND THE STUDENT'S RESEARCH INTO THE MODELING AND VERIFICATION OF FLOWS THAT ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF GENERIC SHAPES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CONCEPTS. THE KEY TECHNOLOGY OF THE WIND TUNNEL IS A SHAPE-MORPHING THROAT MADE FROM A WOVEN CERAMIC MATERIAL. THE SHAPE-MORPHINGTHROAT ALLOWS FOR THE AREA RATIO AND THUS MACH NUMBER TO BE VARIED. THE PARTICULAR DESIGN OF THE THROAT ALLOWS FOR BOTH SYMMETRIC FLOWS (WHERE ONLY THE INVISCID  VARIABLE MACH NUMBER CORE IS IMPORTANT) AND ASYMMETRIC FLOWS (WHERE BOUNDARY LAYER EFFECTS AND SHOCKWAVE INTERACTIONS ARE IMPORTANT). KEY OBJECTIVES: THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO MODEL COMPUTATIONALLY AND VERIFY EXPERIMENTALLY THE BEHAVIOR OF THE FLOW THROUGH THE CONTOURS AND NOZZLE GEOMETRIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHAPE-MORPHING CERAMIC HYPERSONIC WIND TUNNEL. FOR EXAMPLE  A SHAPE MORPHING FREE JET WIND TUNNEL MIGHT EMPLOY EITHER A LENTICULAR OR QUADRICORN SHAPED THROAT TO AVOID SLIDING SEALS. BOTH SYMMETRIC AND ASYMMETRIC FLOWS WILL BE INVESTIGATED. IN PARTICULAR  ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WILL BE SOUGHT: I) HOW ROBUST IS THE RESPONSE OF THE FLOW TO CHANGES IN THROAT SHAPE OR SIZE  THE EXPANSION CONTOUR AND THE LENGTH OF THE EXPANSION REGION? II) WHAT IS THE QUALITY OF THE FLOW STRUCTURES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THROAT SHAPE OR SIZE? III) HOW WELL DO THE MODELS PREDICT THE FLOW PROPERTIES AND ARE THERE DYNAMIC INSTABILITIES THAT OCCUR DUE TO PRESSURE VARIATIONSASSOCIATED WITH THE CUSP SHAPES INVOLVED? IV) IS IT POSSIBLE TO GENERATE HIGH QUALITY ASYMMETRIC FLOWS FROM AN ASYMMETRIC OPENING? METHODS/TECHNIQUES: THE STUDENT WILL DEVELOP THEORETICAL (ANALYTICAL) AND COMPUTATIONAL (COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS) MODELS OF THE FLOW FIELDDOWNSTREAM OF THE THROAT FOR PURPOSES OF PREDICTING THE FLOW FIELD S RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THROAT SHAPE AND SIZE. THE EMPHASIS WILL BE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS I  II  III AND IV FROM A MODELING STANDPOINT.

WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP AND PROCEDURES  NAMELY AN ULTRA HIGH-RESOLUTION TWO VUV LASER PHOTODISSOCIATION PHOTOIONIZATION TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY (2VUV-LPP-TOF-MS)  THAT WOULD ENSURE THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE SOLAR NEBULAR PHOTOCHEMISTRY OF CO. WE DESCRIBE OUR DESIGN CONCEPT AND DEMONSTRATE OUR UNIQUE CAPABILITY TO PERFORM THIS TIMELYEXPERIMENT ON ALL MAJOR BANDS  WITH DATA OBTAINED FROM THE 105.17MN BAND (BAND 31) AS AN EXAMPLE. THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENT WILL BE PERFORMED IN VUV WAVELENGTH RANGE (90-110 NM). AN ULTRA-HIGH RESOLUTION VUV LASER WILL BE SENT ACROSS TWO SEPARATED MOLECULAR BEAMS IN SEQUENCE  THE FIRST ONE IS FOR ATTENUATION OF LIGHT (SHIELDING) BY CO ABSORPTION  AND THE SECOND ONE IS FOR FRAGMENTATIONOF CO BY PHOTODISSOCIATION. FOLLOWING PHOTODISSOCIATION OF CO  ALL ISOTOPIC PHOTO-FRAGMENTS WILL BE DETECTED BY ANOTHER SPATIALLY OVERLAPPED BUT TEMPORALLY SLIGHTLY DELAYED PHOTOIONIZATION VUV LASER  MEETING HEAD TO HEAD WITH THE FIRST VUV. ISOTOPIC EXCHANGE REACTIONS ARE PREVENTED AS NO COLLISION OCCURS DURING FREE EXPANSION OF THE MOLECULAR BEAM; COINCIDENT LINE SHIELDING FROM H2 ONCO PHOTODISSOCIATION WILL BE INCLUDED TO SIMULATE SOLAR NEBULA COMPOSITION; VARIOUS CO TEMPERATURES IN THE RANGE OF 10K TO 150K WILL BE USED TO TEST THE POSSIBLE ASTROPHYSICAL SITES OF SELF-SHIELDING  WHICH ARE UNDER DEBATE IN RECENT SELF-SHIELDING MODELS (CLAYTON 2002; YURIMOTO AND KURAMOTO  2004; LYONS AND YOUNG  2005). THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE CRITICAL ADVANTAGES OF OUR DESIGN WHEN COMPARED TO RECENT EXPERIMENTS BY CHAKRABORTY ET AL (2008). THERE ARE OVER 30 ABSORPTION BANDS OF CO IN VUV WAVELENGTH RANGE (90NM TO 110NM); OF THESE  THE FIVE MOST IMPORTANT BANDS  WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 95% OF THE YIELD OF CO ISOTOPE-SELECTIVE PHOTODISSOCIATION  WILL BE SELECTED FOR THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENT. THE SUCCESS OF THIS EXPERIMENT  TOGETHER WITH THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED OXYGEN ISOTOPE DATA FROM THE GENESIS MISSION (BURNETT 2011; MCKEEGAN ET AL.  2011; MARTY ET AL.  2011) WILL PROVIDE A CRUCIAL PIECEOF INFORMATION IN UNDERSTANDING THE PUZZLE OF THE OBSERVED OXYGEN ISOTOPE ANOMALIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM THAT HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR OVER THREE DECADES (CLAYTON ET AL.  1973) BUT  AS YET  HAVE DEFIED A CONSENSUS EXPLANATION (CLAYTON 1993; MCKEEGAN AND LESHIN  2001; YIN 2004).

DESPITE ITS IMPORTANCE AND ALL THE EFFORTS AIMED AT STUDYING IT  THERE ARE STILL MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ORIGIN  ACCELERATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR WIND. TWO FUNDAMENTAL OPEN QUESTIONS IN SOLAR WIND SCIENCE ARE: 1) WHERE DOES THE SOLAR WIND PLASMA COME FROM  I.E. FROM WHAT TYPE OF PLASMA STRUCTURES AND FROM WHAT REGIONS IN THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE  AND 2) HOW ISTHE SOLAR WIND HEATED AND ACCELERATED? WE PROPOSE TO DIRECTLY AND QUANTITATIVELY COMBINE HIGH-RESOLUTION OBSERVATIONS OF THE EUV EMISSION OF SOLAR CORONAL PLASMAS WITH IN-SITU PLASMA OBSERVATIONS OBTAINED DURING QUADRATURE BETWEEN ULYSSES  SOHO AND HINODE TO ACHIEVE THREE GOALS: 1) TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE REGIONS OF THE FAST AND SLOW SOLAR WIND; 2) TO PROVIDE AN EMPIRICAL DETERMINATION OF WIND PLASMA PARAMETERS AND HEATING; AND 3) TO DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE TOOL THAT USES EMPIRICAL OR MODEL WIND TEMPERATURE  DENSITY AND VELOCITY AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE FROM THE SUN TO PRODUCE DETAILED QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR WIND CHARGE STATE COMPOSITION. PREDICTED CHARGE STATES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE BOTH THE FINAL FROZEN-IN CHARGE STATES IN THE SOLAR WIND  AND THE X-RAY  EUV AND UV EMISSION OF THE WIND SOURCE REGIONS IN THE INNER CORONA. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF SPECTROSCOPIC AND IN SITU TECHNIQUES. WE WILL MEASURE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOLAR WIND SOURCE REGIONS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA FROM SOHO AND HINODE. WE WILL USE THE SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS OF PLASMA PARAMETERS AS INPUT TO THE IONCOMPOSITION MODEL  TOGETHER WITH AN ASSUMED PLASMA VELOCITY FUNCTION  TO PREDICT ION COMPOSITION AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE FROM THE WIND SOURCE REGION. THE ION COMPOSITION WILL BE USED TO 1) COMPARE FROZEN-IN CHARGE STATES WITH ULYSSES MEASUREMENTS AT ONE END OF THE SOLAR WIND TRAJECTORY  AND 2) CALCULATE LINE INTENSITIES AND NARROW-BAND IMAGES IN THE INNERMOST REGIONS OF THE SOLAR CORONA TO BE COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONS FROM THE SPECTROMETERS ON BOARD SOHO AND HINODE AT THE OTHER END OF THE WIND TRAJECTORY. THIS DOUBLE COMPARISON WILL ALLOW US TO: 1) TEST THE ACCURACY OF THE IONIZATION MODEL'S PREDICTION  2) DIRECTLY TEST THE WIND PLASMA PARAMETERS (DENSITY  TEMPERATURE AND VELOCITY) USED AS INPUT TO THE IONIZATION MODEL; AND 3) DEVELOP AN EMPIRICAL MODEL OF THE PLASMA VELOCITY  ACCELERATION AND THERMAL HISTORY BELOW 1.5 SOLAR RADII. THE RESULTS OF THIS PROPOSED WORK WILL BE TWOFOLD. FIRST  WE WILL PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY WITH A NEW  POWERFUL TOOL TO PREDICT THE EVOLUTION OF ION CHARGE STATES IN THE SOLAR WIND  AS WELL AS A NEW METHODOLOGY TO STUDY THE SOLAR WIND QUANTITATIVELY MATCHING TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBSERVATIONS: REMOTE-SENSING OBSERVATIONS AND IN-SITUION COMPOSITION MEASUREMENT. SECOND  THE APPLICATION OF THIS NEW METHODOLOGY TO EXISTING IN SITU AND REMOTE SENSING OBSERVATIONS WILL RESULT IN A) AN ACCURATE EMPIRICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE WIND HEATING AND ACCELERATION; AND B) THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE WIND SOURCE REGIONS.  RESULTS FROM THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATIONS WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL INPUT TO THEORETICAL MODELS OF SOLAR WIND HEATING AND ACCELERATION. THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION WILL PAVE THE WAY TO A NEW METHOD TO STUDY EXISTING DATA FROM NASA MISSIONS AND INSTRUMENTS  ENHANCING THEIR SCIENTIFIC RETURN.

RECENT OBSERVATIONS IN EXTREME ULTRA-VIOLET WAVELENGTHS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE CORONA OSCILLATES AT MANY DIFFERENT SPATIAL SIZES AND TEMPORAL FREQUENCIES. HOWEVER  MUCH REMAINS UNKNOWN ABOUT MANY OF THESE OSCILLATIONS; THEY ARE INTERMITTENT FOR UNKNOWN REASONS  APPEAR ON SOME CORONAL FEATURES AND NOT ON OTHER  SIMILAR  NEIGHBORING FEATURES  AND MAY (OR MAY NOT) BE MAGNETOHYRODYNAMIC WAVE MODES. DEFINITIVE CAUSES OF THE STRUCTURE AND ORIGINS OF THESE OSCILLATIONS IS STILL LARGELY LACKING. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY HOW AND WHY FEATURESIN THE CORONA OSCILLATE  AND IF THEY OSCILLATE AS IDENTIFIABLE WAVE MODES. WE WILL MAKE USE OF AUTOMATED DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF SDO-AIA DATA AVAILABLE. FIRST  WE WILL MEASURE THE OSCILLATION CONTENT OFDIFFERENT PHYSICAL REGIONS ON THE SUN IN SDO AIA DATA. WE WILL DO THIS USING THREE DIFFERENT AUTOMATED OSCILLATION DETECTION ALGORITHMS (DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY) TO VALIDATE THE RESULTS. THE MEASURED OSCILLATION CONTENT WILL BE CORRELATED WITH OTHER MEASURES OF THOSE REGIONS SUCH AS AREA  TOTAL UNSIGNED MAGNETIC FLUX  AND AGE TO OBTAIN BASIC INFORMATION ON THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR AN OSCILLATION TO OCCUR  BASIC INFORMATION THAT HAS  AS YET  NOT BEEN OBTAINED. WE WILL EXTRACT ALL THIS CONTENT IN EACH AIA PASSBAND. FURTHER  WEWILL ROUTINELY MEASURE THE CORONAL OSCILLATION CONTENT OF THE SUN IN THE CURRENT SOLAR CYCLE  AND PROVIDE THOSE MEASUREMENTS ONLINE. SECOND  WE NEED TO KNOW THE PHYSICAL SIZE OF THE COHERENT OSCILLATING STRUCTURE AND WHAT KIND OF STRUCTURE THE OSCILLATIONS OCCUR ON. WE WILL DO THIS BY IMPLEMENTING PIXEL GROUPING AND OSCILLATORY SIGNAL COHERENCE ALGORITHMS TO DETECT COHERENTLY OSCILLATING STRUCTURES. FURTHER  WE WILL DEVELOP A 3D WAVELET ALGORITHM AND A CURVELET-BASED TEXTURE ANALYSIS THAT CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NARROW AND EXTENDED CURVILINEAR FEATURES  SUCH AS CORONAL LOOPS  AND NON-LOOP EMISSION ON THE SUN. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY LOOP-LIKE FEATURES AT MULTIPLE LENGTH-SCALES (LARGE LOOPS IN ACTIVE REGIONS  SMALL LOOPS IN CORONAL HOLES AND QUIET SUN)  AND OTHER TYPES OF EMISSION  SUCH AS PLAGE OR MOSS IN EACH AIA PASSBAND. THIRD  WE WILL STUDY OF ORIGINS OF LONGITUDINAL OSCILLATIONS AND FLARE-INDUCED KINK WAVES. THE COMBINATION OF AUTOMATED DETECTION OF THE OSCILLATIONS  AND THE STRUCTURE SUPPORTING THESE OSCILLATIONS  AS MEASURED IN EACH OF THE SDO PASSBANDS  WILL ALLOW US TO TEST THEORIES OF OSCILLATION PROPAGATION  CORONAL HEATING  AND ENERGY DECAY MECHANISMS IN THE SOLARATMOSPHERE.

HOWEVER  RECENT ACCIDENT DATA [1] INDICATES A TREND IN THE WRONG DIRECTION  PARTICULARLY AMONG INTERNATIONAL OPERATORS. A NUMBER OF RECENT ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED WITH HIGHLY AUTOMATED MODERN AIRCRAFT WHERE FLIGHT CREWS EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF ATTITUDE STATE AWARENESS (LASA) AND/OR A LOSS OF ENERGY STATE AWARENESS (LESA). THE RECENT AIR FRANCE 447 ACCIDENT (5/31/2009) IS A STARK EXAMPLE OF AN ACCIDENT DUE TO LESA DESPITE ENVELOPE PROTECTION AND A WELL-TRAINED CREW.

AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF MATERIAL DESIGN ARE COMPLEX MATERIALS: HYBRIDS  COMPOSITES  AND ALLOYS WHOSE CONSTITUENTSAND PROCESSING DETAILS CAN LEAD TO A WIDE RANGE OF PROPERTIES. THE DESIGN OF A COMPLEX MATERIAL CAN BE FOCUSED TOWARDS SPECIFIC OR MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS  AND TAILORED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A GIVEN MISSION.HYBRID MATERIALS ARE DEFINED BY TWO DISTINCT CONSTITUENTS MIXED AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL  USUALLY AN INORGANIC PHASE INTERMIXED WITH LARGE ORGANIC MOLECULES. THE FIELD OF NANOCOMPOSITES INTERSECTS SOMEWHAT WITH THE FIELD OF HYBRID MATERIALS  THOUGH COMPOSITE MATERIALS ARE TYPICALLY DISTINGUISHED BY LARGER SPATIAL SEPARATION BETWEEN CONSTITUENTS. COMPLEX MATERIALS MAY OFFER THE PROPERTIES OFTWO DIFFERENT MATERIALS IN PARALLEL  WITH ADDITIONAL EFFECTS DUE TO CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS. FURTHERMORE  ALLOYS AND HYBRIDS CAN FORM THE CONSTITUENTS OF ADVANCED COMPOSITES. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE EXTREMELY NUMEROUS IN DESIGNING COMPLEX MATERIALS  TO THE EXTENT THATEXPERIMENTAL TRIAL AND ERROR BECOMES IMPRACTICAL AND COSTLY. WE PROPOSE THAT MATERIAL SIMULATION TECHNIQUES MAY HAVE MUCH TO OFFER IN THE DESIGN OF COMPLEX MATERIALS  FROM HIGH-THROUGHPUT MATERIAL SELECTION TO DETAILED OBSERVATION OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES IN A GIVEN ENVIRONMENT.HERE  WE FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATOMISTIC (ATOM-BY-ATOM) MODELS FOR COMPLEX MATERIALS IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. EMPIRICAL MODELS  IN WHICH ATOMS ARE ASSUMED TO EXHIBIT PARAMETERIZED INTERATOMIC POTENTIALS  OFTEN LACK THE TRANSFERABILITY NECESSARY TO EXPLORE EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE TYPICALLY FIT TO A SET OF PROPERTIES WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELIABLE OUTSIDE OF THE RANGE OF FITTING. FOR THIS REASON  IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPLOY QUANTUM MECHANICAL METHODS AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER  COMPLEX MATERIAL SYSTEMS NATURALLY REQUIRE A LARGE NUMBER OF ATOMS TO CONSTRUCT A REPRESENTATIVE UNIT  PRESENTING A PROBLEM FOR QUANTUM METHODS IN WHICH COMPUTATION TIME SCALES AT BEST QUADRATICALLY WITH SYSTEM SIZE.DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY (DFT) CALCULATIONS HAVE BECOME WIDELY UTILIZED IN MATERIAL SIMULATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR REMARKABLE ABILITY TO REPRODUCE MEASURED QUANTITIES. DFT CALCULATIONS ARE LIMITED TO A FEW HUNDRED ATOMS ON A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SYSTEM. THIS MAY BE ENOUGH TO STUDY THE GROUND STATE PROPERTIES OF COMPLEX MATERIAL SYSTEMS  BUT DFT IS KNOWN TO MISREPRESENT CERTAIN INTERACTIONS THAT ARE LIKELY RELEVANT TO THE PROBLEM OF COMPLEX MATERIALS DESIGN  SUCH AS VAN DER WAALS (VDW) BONDING. EMPIRICAL EXTENSIONS TO DFT ARE COMMONLY EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE RESOLUTION OF SUCH MISREPRESENTED EFFECTS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE EMPIRICAL CORRECTIONS TO QUANTUM MODELS AND/OR APPLICATION OF KNOWN MACROSCOPIC PROPERTIES TO SHRINK THE REPRESENTATIVE UNIT FOR ATOMISTIC CALCULATIONS. SUCH APPROXIMATIONSWILL CERTAINLY BE NECESSARY TO APPROACH THE PROBLEM OF MODELING COMPLEX MATERIALS  ESPECIALLY IN CONSIDERATION OF TIME-DEPENDENT PROCESSES IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS.WE CONSIDER ONE IMPORTANT APPLICATION IN SPACE TECHNOLOGY: DESIGN OF HYBRID MATERIALS FOR THERMALLY PROTECTIVE ABLATORS DURING ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY. ENGINEERED HYBRID MATERIALS ARE ATTRACTIVE FOR THIS APPLICATION  AS THERE WILL BE A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR A GIVEN ASCENT. MECHANICAL STABILITY AND PRECISELY TUNED ABLATION CHARACTERISTICS ARE DESIRABLE  AND THERE IS POTENTIAL TO ENGINEER ENHANCED OPTICAL PROPERTIES (AT ATOMIC AS WELL AS PHOTONIC SCALES) TO REDUCE RADIATIVE HEATING. THE ACTUAL THERMAL  MECHANICAL  AND OPTICAL DESIGN GOALS WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE ATMOSPHERE AND VEHICLE OF INTEREST.

THESE GPS NETWORKS ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME. THEY ARE USED PRIMARILY FOR POSITIONING AND TO PROVIDE PRECISE ORBITS FOR MANY NASA SATELLITE AND AIRBORNE MISSIONS. IT HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED THAT DATA FROM THESE SAME SITES CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE INTEGRATED MEASUREMENTS OF WATER VAPOR AND TOTAL ELECTRON CONTENT  THUS MAKING GPS A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ATMOSPHERE. MORE RECENTLY IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THESE SAME GPS GROUND NETWORKS  IF PROPERLY SITED  PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE LAND SURFACE SURROUNDING THE GPS ANTENNA  IN THE FORM OF SOIL MOISTURE  SNOW DEPTH  AND BIOMASS PRODUCTS. THE BENEFIT OF REFLECTION DATA DERIVED FROM GPS GROUND NETWORKS FOR HYDROLOGICAL STUDIES WOULD BE THREE-FOLD. FIRST  BY USING NETWORKS THAT ALREADY EXIST AND HAVE SUPPORT FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES  NASA WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE USEFUL SCIENTIFIC DATA AT LOW COST. SECONDLY  THE FOOTPRINT OF A GROUND GPS SITE IS INTERMEDIATE TO IN SITU PROBES AND SATELLITE SENSORS. THE FORMER (10S OF CMS) FAILS TO CAPTURE THE TRUE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THE HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETER WHILE THE LATER IS OFTEN TOO LARGE (10S OF KMS). ASSIMILATION MODELS THAT INCLUDE BOTH IN SITU AND SATELLITE DATA CAN BE IMPROVED BY HAVING SUCH AN INTERMEDIATE-SCALE SENSOR. FINALLY  HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENT  AS SOIL MOISTURE DATA ARE USED IN WEATHER FORECASTS AND CLIMATE MODELS. SNOWPACK AND MELT RATE INFORMATION ARE NEEDED FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER SUPPLY AND FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEMS  PARTICULARLY IN THE MORE ARID WESTERN U.S. ESTIMATES OF BIOMASS/VEGETATION STATE ARE ALSO REQUIRED FOR ASSIMILATION MODELS AND FOR VALIDATION OF SATELLITE SURVEYS OF LAND SURFACE CONDITIONS. WHILE THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP NEW HYDROLOGICAL PRODUCTS FROM GPS REFLECTION DATA  KNOWLEDGE OF HYDROLOGICAL SIGNALS IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING POSITIONING ACCURACY OF GPS. THE LATTER IS A KEY DRIVER IN THE ACCURACY OF THE INTERNATIONAL TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME. GIVEN THE MATURITY OF GPS NETWORKS  IT IS APPROPRIATE NOW TO USE MODELS  SUCH AS GLDAS (GLOBAL LAND DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM)  TO DEVELOP HYDROLOGICAL LOADING CORRECTIONS FOR GPS NETWORKS. TOGETHER WITH ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING EFFECTS  GPS VERTICAL PRECISION CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. THIS RESEARCH WILL SUPPORT NASA MISSIONS SUCH AS GRACE AND DESDYNI. ITS RELEVANCE TO THE ADVANCED GEODETIC CONCEPTS NRA INCLUDES THE CALL FOR NEW MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES FOR GPS REFLECTIONS. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL ASSEMBLE A COLLECTION OF DATA SETS DERIVED FROM GPS NETWORKS FOR DIRECT USE IN EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE STUDIES. THE PRIMARY NETWORK USED IN THIS STUDY WILL BE THE EARTHSCOPE PLATE BOUNDARY OBSERVATORY (PBO) BUILT BY NSF IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA AND THE USGS. THIS STUDY WILL YIELD A (1) DATABASE OF SNOW DEPTH (AND SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT)  (2) DATABASE OF BIOMASS  (3) ANCILLARY ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SETS OF PRECIPITATION  TEMPERATURE  AND VEGETATION PRODUCTS (4) HYDROLOGICAL LOADING EFFECTS  (5) ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING EFFECTS AND (6) TEST THE ABILITY OF THESE PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE AND UNDERSTAND HOW HYDROLOGICAL FORCING INFLUENCES GLDAS.

HOWEVER  OFTENTIMES CFD CAN ONLY BE USED WITH CONFIDENCE AT NEAR DESIGN CONDITIONS WHERE THE FLOW IS MOSTLY ATTACHED. THE ABILITY TO RELIABLY PREDICT FLOW SEPARATION  INCLUDING SEPARATION ONSET AND PROGRESSION  HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE MAJORIMPEDIMENTS TO MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN CYCLE. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THIS CAPABILITY WILL ENABLE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF COMPLEX FLOW PHYSICS DRIVING IMPORTANT DESIGN METRICS  WHICH IN TURN WILL ENABLE MORE AGGRESSIVE DESIGNS AT LOWER RISK. NEW CONCEPTS AND CONFIGURATIONS OFTEN RELY ON DIFFERENT FLOW PHYSICS THAT PROGRAMS MUST BE ABLE TO SIMULATE WITH CONFIDENCE IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE DESIGNS AND REDUCE RISK. AT THE SAME TIME  SIMULATIONS FOR TRADITIONAL FIXED WING CONFIGURATIONS ARE SEVERELY LACKING IN CRITICAL REGIONS OF THE FLIGHT REGIME SUCH AS NEAR STALL  AT HIGH-LIFT CONDITIONS  IN DEFLECTED CONTROL SURFACE CONDITIONS AND AT THE EDGES OF THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE. IN ALL THESE CASES  THE ABILITY TO EXPAND THE USE OF CFD TO A WIDER VARIETY OF CONFIGURATIONS AND THROUGH ALL REGIONS OF THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE WILL GREATLY IMPACT ALL THE IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE METRICS SUCH AS DRAG  FUEL BURN AND EMISSIONS  ACOUSTICS  FLOW CONTROL  HIGH LIFT EFFECTIVENESS  AND STABILITY AND CONTROL.THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A CAPABILITY FOR ACCURATELY PREDICTING AERODYNAMIC FLOWS OVER REALISTIC AND COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS INVOLVING SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF FLOW SEPARATION. ALTHOUGH REYNOLDS-AVERAGED NAVIER-STOKES (RANS) TURBULENCE MODELS CAN BE USED WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE FOR FULLY ATTACHED FLOWS OR FOR FLOWS WITH SMALL REGIONS OF SEPARATION  RELIABLE ANDACCURATE SIMULATION OF AERODYNAMIC FLOWS WITH MODERATE TO MASSIVE REGIONS OF SEPARATION REMAINS CHALLENGING. BY RESOLVING A LARGER PORTION OF THE TURBULENCE SPECTRA  TECHNIQUES SUCH AS LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION (LES) OFFER THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE UNIVERSALLY ACCURATE MODELS APPLICABLE TO A WIDER RANGE OF SEPARATED FLOWS. HOWEVER  EXISTING LES METHODS FACE THREE BASIC PROBLEMS: A HUGE VARIETY OFLES MODELS ARE CURRENTLY APPLIED  DYNAMIC LES METHODS ARE EITHER VERY EXPENSIVE OR HAVE TO BE COMBINED WITH FLOW-DEPENDENT EMPIRICAL STABILIZATION TECHNIQUES  AND THE COST OF LES FOR WALL-BOUNDED FLOW SIMULATIONS ARE WAY TOO HIGH FOR MOST APPLICATIONS. A SOLUTION APPROACH FOR THESE THREE PROBLEMS WAS RECENTLY SUGGESTED BY THE PI. BY USING A STOCHASTIC TURBULENCE MODEL HE DEVELOPED A HIERARCHY OF REALIZABLE LES MODELS  CORRESPONDING DYNAMIC LES METHODS THAT OVER-COME THE STABILITY PROBLEMS OF EXISTING DYNAMICLES METHODS  AND UNIFIED RANS-LES MODELS THAT ENABLE A HUGE COMPUTATIONAL COST REDUCTION BY A FACTOR OF 5.7 RE^0.42 (RE REFERS TO THE REYNOLDS NUMBER). THESE NEW UNIFIED AND DYNAMIC LES METHODS HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES COMPARED TO EXISTING METHODS. ON THE OTHER HAND  THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THESE METHODS DO NOT REPRESENT THE FINAL ANSWER TO THE THREE LES PROBLEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE BECAUSE OF THEIR DEFICIENCIES IN ACCURATELY REPRESENTING THE SPATIOTEMPORAL STRUCTURE OF TURBULENT FLOWS. THE FIRST SPECIFIC PROJECT GOAL IS TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REALIZABLE STOCHASTIC TURBULENCE MODEL THAT PRESERVES THE SPACE-TIME STRUCTURE OF TURBULENCE  AND TO USE THIS MODEL FOR THE DERIVATION OF HIERARCHICAL LES  DYNAMIC LES  AND UNIFIED RANS-LES METHODS. THE SECOND SPECIFIC PROJECT GOAL IS TO SHOW THE SUCCESS OF DYNAMIC LES AND UNIFIED RANS-LES METHODS THROUGH APPLICATIONS INVOLVING FLOW SEPARATION. THIS GOAL WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY A CAREFULLY ORGANIZED VALIDATION PLAN INVOLVING CANONICAL TEST CASES  THE VALIDATION OF AIRFOIL SEPARATION AND STALL BEHAVIOR AND FINALLY THE STUDY OF COMPLEX VALIDATION CASES (MULTI-ELEMENT AIRFOILS/WINGS  TIP VORTEX PREDICTION AND SHOCK BOUNDARY LAYER INTERACTION).\",\"Start Date\":\"2012-08-03\",\"End Date\":\"2017-02-02\",\"Award Amount\":508321.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":null,\"Funding Sub Agency\":null,\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX12AJ71A_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49203286,\"Award ID\":\"NNX12AJ63G\",\"Recipient Name\":\"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS\",\"Description\":\"TESTING CARBON MONOXIDE SELF-SHIELDING MODEL WITH LABORATORY EXPERIMENT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM&#039;S OXYGEN ISOTOPE EVOLUTI\",\"Start Date\":\"2012-07-01\",\"End Date\":\"2014-06-30\",\"Award Amount\":170000.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":null,\"Funding Sub Agency\":null,\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX12AJ63G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49203285,\"Award ID\":\"NNX12AJ62A\",\"Recipient Name\":\"BROWN UNIVERSITY\",\"Description\":\"IN RESPONSE TO ROA-2011  APPENDIX A-2  SUBSONIC FIXED WING (SFW1)  SECTION 2.2: NUMERICAL METHODS FOR TURBULENT FLOW COMPUTATIONS  WE PROPOSE TO PERFORM RESEARCH ON HIGH ORDER DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN (DG) AND WEIGHTED ESSENTIALLY NON-OSCILLATORY (WENO) ALGORITHMS FOR COMPRESSIBLE TURBULENCESIMULATIONS.

HOWEVER  THEY HAVE NOT BEEN RIGOROUSLY VALIDATED  AND THEIR UNCERTAINTIES AND SYSTEMATIC ERRORS ARE NOT WELL CHARACTERIZED. WE PROPOSE TO VALIDATE: (I)DAILY MODIS FRACTIONAL SNOW COVER  CALCULATED BY BOTH NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE SNOW INDEX (NASA STANDARD PRODUCTS MOD10A1 AND MYD10A1)  AND SPECTRAL UNMIXING; (II) DAILY SNOW ALBEDO; AND (III) SPATIOTEMPORALLY SMOOTHED FRACTIONAL SNOW COVER AND ALBEDO  AS A MONTHLY PRODUCT. FOR SEVERAL WET AND DRY YEARS  WE WILL ASSEMBLE A SET OF PRODUCTS AND THEIR VALIDATION DATASETS. THE VALIDATION DATA WILL INCLUDE A COMPREHENSIVE (~1000) SET OF LANDSAT SCENES  AUGMENTED AT SOME LOCATIONS AND TIMES BY HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA (DIGITIZED AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS  QUICKBIRD IMAGER  AND DECLASSIFIED IMAGES FROM NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE SATELLITES) FROM WHICH ACCURATE BINARY MAPS OF SNOW COVER CAN BE CREATED. WE WILL VALIDATE SNOW IN THE FORESTS WITH EXISTING LIDAR SNOW SURVEY DATA  TO CHARACTERIZE SNOW DEPTH VARIABILITY AT SUB-METER SCALES  INCLUDING SUB-CANOPY AREAS. WE WILL USE ALSO USE EXISTING ULTRASONIC SNOW DEPTH SENSORS TO CHARACTERIZE SNOW ACCUMULATION  MELT  AND DURATION IN OPEN  CANOPY-EDGE  AND SUB-CANOPY CONDITIONS.

DURING PERSISTENT CLOUD COVER  THE ONLY VIEW OF THE GROUND FOR A WEEK OR TWO MIGHT WELL BE AT SUCH A HIGHLY OBLIQUE ANGLE. TO EVALUATE FRACTIONAL SNOW COVER IN THOSE SITUATIONS  WE WILL USE LANDSAT TM OR ETM+ SCENES THAT COINCIDE WITH THE EDGES OF SNOW-COVERED MODIS IMAGES. WE WILL COMPARE TIME-SPACE SMOOTHING AND INTERPOLATION TO A SEQUENCE OF LANDSAT TM OR ETM+ SCENES OVER THE SIERRA NEVADA FROM 2000 TO PRESENT  FOCUSING ESPECIALLY ON LOCATIONS AND TIMES WHEN THE SMOOTHED AND INTERPOLATED PRODUCT DIFFERS FROM THE RAW MODIS FRACTIONAL SNOW COVER. WE WILL VALIDATE BOTH THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUITY PRODUCT'S PREDICTIVE MODE (ESTIMATE SNOW-COVER ON A GIVEN DAY USING ONLY DATA PRIOR TO THAT DAY) AND ITS RETROSPECTIVE MODE (RECONSTRUCT THE HISTORY OF SNOW PROPERTIES FOR A PRIOR PERIOD.) WE HAVE ACCESS TO SNOW ALBEDO DATA AND COINCIDENT AVIRIS IMAGERY FROM FIELD SITES AT THE SENATOR BECK BASIN IN THE SAN JUAN MOUNTAINS  COLORADO AND AT MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN IN THE SIERRA NEVADA  CALIFORNIA. WE WILL USE THESE DATA TO VALIDATE AVIRIS-DERIVED SNOW ALBEDO  AND THEN COINCIDENT AVIRIS/MODIS DATA TO VALIDATE MODIS-DERIVED ALBEDO. THE MODIS CLOUD PRODUCT CONTAINS ERRORS OF BOTH OMISSION AND COMMISSION  AND ALL MODIS SNOW PRODUCTS SOMETIMES CONFUSE CLOUDS AND SNOW. THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUITY PRODUCT ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT THIS BY FORCING SNOW THAT IS TOO FINE-GRAINED AND COVERS THE WHOLE PIXEL TO BE CLASSIFIED AS CLOUD  WHILE CLOUDS THAT ARE TOO COARSE-GRAINED ARE CLASSIFIED AS SNOW. WE WILL VALIDATE THIS APPROACH USING LANDSAT TM AND ETM+  WHICH CAN IDENTIFY CLOUDS BOTH BY TEXTURE AND BY SNOW/CLOUD CONTRAST IN BAND 5. SNOWMELT RUNOFF FORECASTING IN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS HAS HISTORICALLY USED EMPIRICAL MODELS FORCED BY SPARSE  IN SITU MEASUREMENTS.

TRACKING SYSTEM'S ABILITY TO PREPARE FOR  AND TO PROVIDE EARLY WARNING TO  POPULATIONS AT RISK. THE THREE PRIMARY TASKS ARE TO: (1) ASSIMILATE PRODUCTS FROM NASA SATELLITE SENSORS INTO EPA'S COMMUNITY MULTI-SCALE AIR QUALITY (CMAQ) MODEL AND THE DUST REGIONAL ATMOSPHERIC MODEL (DREAM). FOR HUMAN HEALTH APPLICATIONS  THESE INCLUDE (A) BI-MONTHLY LAND COVER CHARACTERIZATIONS DERIVED FROM MODIS DATA THAT ARE AVAILABLE DAILY FROM BOTH THE TERRA AND AQUA OBSERVATORIES; (B) MODIS AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH MEASUREMENTS FROM TERRA AND AQUA; AND  (C) AEROSOL PROFILE PRODUCTS FROM CALIPSO AND GLORY; (2) VERIFY AND VALIDATE MODEL OUTPUTS AND ASSESS IMPROVEMENTS TO OZONE  DUST  AND OTHER AEROSOL FORECASTS; (3) ENHANCE EPHTS AND EPHTN DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS WITH MODEL OUTPUTS AND FORECASTS. BI-MONTHLY INPUTS OF LAND COVER THAT INCLUDES A BARREN LAND CATEGORY WILL HELP CMAQ AND DREAM TO SIMULATE DESERT DUST PRODUCTION AND BIOGENICALLY EMITTED CHEMICALS SUCH AS ISOPRENE AND MONOTERPENES. IN ADDITION  SATELLITE AEROSOL MEASUREMENTS WILL HELP SET MORE REALISTIC INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE MODELS. THIS PROJECT ENGINEERS A NEW COURSE FOR INCORPORATING SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF AEROSOLS AND LAND COVER CHANGE DATA INTO FORECAST MODELS THAT SUPPORT HEALTH DECISIONS. TO TEST THE TWO TASKS AND TRANSITION OUTPUTS TO EPHTS AND EPHTN  THE PROJECT WILL COLLABORATE WITH NEW MEXICO'S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND CDC'S ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH TRACKING PROGRAM. BENEFITS ARE: (1) INCORPORATING EARTH SCIENCE RESULTS FOR HEALTH CARE AND DECISION MAKING IN RESPIRATORY DISEASE DIAGNOSES AND SURVEILLANCE; (2) IMPROVING COST EFFECTIVENESS OF INPATIENT HEALTH CARE BY PROVIDING 36-48 HOUR FORECASTS THAT ASSIST DECISIONS FOR HOSPITAL STAFFING  DIAGNOSIS  AND TREATMENT; AND  (3) EXPANDING THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN EARLIER AIR QUALITY/HEALTH EFFORTS TO AN ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY MODEL IN THE PM2.5 AND FINER SIZE RANGES.\",\"Start Date\":\"2008-03-28\",\"End Date\":null,\"Award Amount\":1242016.99,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX08AL15G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49195478,\"Award ID\":\"NNX08AI45G\",\"Recipient Name\":\"UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO\",\"Description\":\"CHLORINE ISOTOPE DISTRIBUTION IN CHONDRITIC METEORITES: SEARCH FOR MULTIPLE NEBULAR RESERVOIRSWE COMBINE THE DIVERSE EXPERTISE OF THREE P.I.S (MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY  PLANETARY MATERIALS  ELEMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND STABLE ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY) TO USE A NOVEL GEOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUE TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE PRIMARY NASA ORIGINS OBJECTIVES  \\\"STRATEGIC SUB-GOAL 3 RELATING TO THE FORMATION OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM\\\". WE PROPOSE TO ANALYZE THE CHLORINE ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF A DIVERSE SUITE OF CARBONACEOUS  ORDINARY AND ENSTATITE CHONDRITES IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE DEGREE OF CL ISOTOPE HETEROGENEITY OF THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA. CHLORINE IS AN UNUSUAL ELEMENT IN THAT EQUILIBRIUM ISOTOPE FRACTIONATIONS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL AND THE NUMBER OF NEBULAR PHASES THAT CONTAIN CHLORINE IS VERY LIMITED. THEREFORE FRACTIONATION (OR A LACK THEREOF) OF CL ISOTOPES BETWEEN METEORITE TYPES AND/OR INDIVIDUAL PHASES CAN PLACE PROFOUND CONSTRAINTS ON EARLY NEBULAR CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE  HCL AND NACL ARE CONSIDERED AS MAJOR CL-BEARING HIGH-T PHASES IN THE EARLY NEBULA. THE CL ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION BETWEEN THEM IS LARGE ENOUGH SO THAT RAYLEIGH FRACTIONATION PROCESSES COULD CONTRIBUTE TO LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE CL ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF DIFFERENT PHASES. IF  HOWEVER  ONLY ONE OF THESE TWO GASES WAS PREVALENT  THEN NO ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION COULD HAVE OCCURRED. WE WILL ANALYZE WATER-SOLUBLE CL AND INSOLUBLE RESIDUE FROM BULK CHONDRITE SAMPLES USING A HIGH-SENSITIVITY MICRO-ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE DEVELOPED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO. ONLY 20 MICROGRAMS OF CL ARE NEEDED FOR AN ANALYSIS  MAKING ANALYSES OF RARE METEORITES FEASIBLE. WE WILL ALSO MAKE IN SITU ANALYSES OF WELL CHARACTERIZED CL-BEARING PHASES  SODALITE  APATITE  AND GLASS USING THE UCLA CAMECA IONPROBE. WE WILL USE SODALITE  APATITE AND SYNTHETIC GLASS STANDARDS  DEVELOPED IN OUR FACILITY  TO AVOID INSTRUMENT FRACTIONATIONS. IN OUR ORIGINAL WORK (NATURE 446  1062-1065)  WE FOUND THAT THE SODALITE IN ALLENDE CHONDRITE WAS OVER 1 PER MIL LIGHTER THAN THE BULK SAMPLE. IF  UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION  THESE DATA ARE CONFIRMED  IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE WAS AN EARLY  HIGH TEMPERATURE FRACTIONATION BETWEEN NACL (GAS) AND HCL (GAS)  PRESENT IN SUB-EQUAL AMOUNTS THAT RESULTED IN TWO DISTINCT CL RESERVOIRS. BY ANALYZING A DIVERSE SUITE OF METEORITES  WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN CL ISOTOPE VALUES AND OTHER GEOCHEMICAL INDICATORS  SUCH AS 17-O ANOMALIES. THREE YEARS OF FUNDING ARE REQUESTED  FORMING THE MAJOR PART OF A GRADUATE STUDENT'S THESIS. AFTER HAVING SPENT SEVERAL YEARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING  WE HAVE ARRIVED AT A POINT WHERE CL ISOTOPE MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE RAPIDLY  ON SMALL AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL  AND WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY. BY STUDYING A LARGE NUMBER OF PRIMITIVE CHONDRITIC METEORITES  WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE THE FULL RANGE OF CL ISOTOPE VARIATION IN THIS GROUP  AND TO EVALUATE THE DATA IN TERMS OF PETROLOGIC TYPE  WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING CL-BEARING PHASE RELATIONS IN THE EARLY SOLAR NEBULA.\",\"Start Date\":\"2008-05-01\",\"End Date\":null,\"Award Amount\":221998.07,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX08AI45G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49193805,\"Award ID\":\"NNX07AH53G\",\"Recipient Name\":\"THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO\",\"Description\":\"BEYOND THE COOL CORES IN GALAXY CLUSTERS: TESTING A HIERARCHICAL MODEL WITH X-RAY OBSERVATIONS AND A\",\"Start Date\":\"2007-04-05\",\"End Date\":\"2012-05-29\",\"Award Amount\":332700.0,\"Awarding Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Awarding Sub Agency\":\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\",\"Funding Agency\":null,\"Funding Sub Agency\":null,\"awarding_agency_id\":862,\"agency_slug\":\"national-aeronautics-and-space-administration\",\"generated_internal_id\":\"ASST_NON_NNX07AH53G_8000\"},{\"internal_id\":49191818,\"Award ID\":\"NNA09DA76A\",\"Recipient Name\":\"THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY\",\"Description\":\"TITLE: SIGNATURES OF LIFE FROM EARTH AND BEYOND IS IN RESPONSE TO CAN #NNH08ZDA002C  NASA ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE  -  CYCLE 5  BASIC AWARD FOR CYCLE FIVE OF NAI TO PENN STATE.1260.51 COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT SPECIAL CONDITION.
